Wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him. 
The Wolf, looking up, said, "Sirrah! I hear thee:  yet it is not
thou who mockest me, but the roof on which thou art standing."  
Time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the
strong.  
The Ox and the Frog 
AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and
crushed one of them to death.  The Mother coming up, and missing
one of her sons, inquired of his brothers what had become of him. 
"He is dead, dear Mother; for just now a very huge beast with
four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with
his cloven heel."  The Frog, puffing herself out, inquired, "if
the beast was as big as that in size."  "Cease, Mother, to puff
yourself out," said her son, "and do not be angry; for you would,
I assure you, sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness
of that monster."  
The Shepherd and the Wolf 
 A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and
after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring
flocks.  The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the
Shepherd, "Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep a
sharp lookout, or you will lose some of your own flock."  
The Father and His Two Daughters 
A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the
other to a tile-maker.  After a time he went to the daughter who
had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all
things went with her.  She said, "All things are prospering with
me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of
rain, in order that the plants may be well watered."  Not long
after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and
likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, "I want for
nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may
continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks
might be dried."  He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain,
and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my
wishes?'  
The Farmer and His Sons 
A FATHER, being on the point of death, wished to be sure that his
sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had
given it.  He called them to his bedside and said, "My sons,
there is a great treasure hid in one of my vineyards."  The sons,
after his death, took their spades and mattocks and carefully dug
over every portion of their land.  They found no treasure, but
the vines repaid their labor by an extraordinary and
superabundant crop.  
The Crab and Its Mother 
A CRAB said to her son, "Why do you walk so one-sided, my child?
It is far more becoming to go straight forward."  The young Crab
replied:  "Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the
straight way, I will promise to walk in it."  The Mother tried in
vain, and submitted without remonstrance to the reproof of her
child.  
Example is more powerful than precept.  
The Heifer and the Ox 
A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and
tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being
compelled to labor.  Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival,
the owner released the Ox from his yoke, but bound the Heifer
with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of
the occasion.  The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a
smile to the Heifer:  "For this you were allowed to live in
idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed."  
The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice 
A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling
with men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice
and there hatched seven young birds.  A Serpent gliding past the
nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged
nestlings.  The Swallow, finding her nest empty, lamented greatly
and exclaimed:  "Woe to me a stranger! that in this place where
all others' rights are protected, I alone should suffer wrong."  
The Thief and His Mother 
A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took
it home to his Mother.  She not only abstained from beating him,
but encouraged him.  He next time stole a cloak and brought it to
her, and she again commended him.  The Youth, advanced to
adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater value.  At
last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands bound
behind him, was led away to the place of public execution.  His
Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in
sorrow, whereupon the young man said, "I wish to say something to
my Mother in her ear."  She came close to him, and he quickly
seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off.  The Mother
upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied, "Ah! if
you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that
lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus
led to a disgraceful death."  
The Old Man and Death 
AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in
carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very
wearied with his long journey.  He sat down by the wayside, and
throwing down his load, besought "Death" to come.  "Death"
immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for what
reason he had called him.  The Old Man hurriedly replied, "That,
lifting up the load, you may place it again upon my shoulders."  
The Fir-Tree and the Bramble 
A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, "You are useful for
nothing at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs and houses."
The Bramble answered:  'You poor creature, if you would only call
to mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down, you
would have reason to wish that you had grown up a Bramble, not a
Fir-Tree."  
Better poverty without care, than riches with.  
The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk 
A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed
an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part
in the water.  The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the
foot of the Mouse tightly to his own.  Thus joined together, the
Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the meadow where
they were accustomed to find their food.  After this, he
gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until
reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the
Mouse with him.  The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam
croaking about, as if he had done a good deed.  The unhappy Mouse
was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about
on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog.  A Hawk observed
it, and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft.  The
Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also
carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.  
Harm hatch, harm catch.  
The Man Bitten by a Dog 
A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone
who might heal him.  A friend, meeting him and learning what he
wanted, said, "If you would be cured, take a piece of bread, and
dip it in the blood from your wound, and go and give it to the
Dog that bit you."  The Man who had been bitten laughed at this
advice and said, "Why? If I should do so, it would be as if I
should beg every Dog in the town to bite me."  
Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of
injuring you.  
The Two Pots 
A RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of
earthenware and the other of brass.  The Earthen Pot said to the
Brass Pot, "Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for
if you touch me ever so slightly, I shall be broken in pieces,
and besides, I by no means wish to come near you."  
Equals make the best friends.  
The Wolf and the Sheep 
A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in
his lair.  Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was
passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing
close beside him.  "For," he said, "if you will bring me drink, I
will find means to provide myself with meat."  "Yes," said the
Sheep, "if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless
make me provide the meat also."  
Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.  
The Aethiop 
THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color of
his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his
former masters.  On bringing him home he resorted to every means
of cleaning, and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings.  The
servant caught a severe cold, but he never changed his color or
complexion.  
What's bred in the bone will stick to the flesh.  
The Fisherman and His Nets 
A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast
and captured a great haul of fish.  He managed by a skillful
handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them
to the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from
falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.  
The Huntsman and the Fisherman 
A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by
chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden
with fish.  The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner
experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game-bag. 
They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day's sport. 
Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some
time the same exchange day after day.  Finally a neighbor said to
them, "If you go on in this way, you will soon destroy by
frequent use the pleasure of your exchange, and each will again
wish to retain the fruits of his own sport."  
Abstain and enjoy.  
The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar 
AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of
prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its
former contents.  She greedily placed it several times to her
nose, and drawing it backwards and forwards said, "O most
delicious! How nice must the Wine itself have been, when it
leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a
perfume!"  
The memory of a good deed lives.  
The Fox and the Crow 
A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it
in her beak.  A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat
himself, and by a wily stratagem succeeded.  "How handsome is the
Crow," he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in the
fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal to
her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of
Birds!"  This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to refute
the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped
the flesh.  The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the
Crow:  "My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit is
wanting."  
The Two Dogs 
A MAN had two dogs:  a Hound, trained to assist him in his sports,
and a Housedog, taught to watch the house.  When he returned home
after a good day's sport, he always gave the Housedog a large
share of his spoil.  The Hound, feeling much aggrieved at this,
reproached his companion, saying, "It is very hard to have all
this labor, while you, who do not assist in the chase, luxuriate
on the fruits of my exertions."  The Housedog replied, "Do not
blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not
taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of
others."  
Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.  
The Stag in the Ox-Stall 
A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the
danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and hid
himself in a shed among the oxen.  An Ox gave him this kindly
warning:  "O unhappy creature! why should you thus, of your own
accord, incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your
enemy?'  The Stag replied:  "Only allow me, friend, to stay where I
am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of
effecting my escape."  At the approach of the evening the herdsman
came to feed his cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the
farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and
failed to notice him.  The Stag, congratulating himself on his
safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had
kindly helped him in the hour of need.  One of them again
answered him:  "We indeed wish you well, but the danger is not
over.  There is one other yet to pass through the shed, who has
as it were a hundred eyes, and until he has come and gone, your
life is still in peril."  At that moment the master himself
entered, and having had to complain that his oxen had not been
properly fed, he went up to their racks and cried out:  "Why is
there such a scarcity of fodder? There is not half enough straw
for them to lie on.  Those lazy fellows have not even swept the
cobwebs away."  While he thus examined everything in turn, he
spied the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out of the
straw.  Then summoning his laborers, he ordered that the Stag
should be seized and killed.  
The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons 
THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called upon
the Hawk to defend them.  He at once consented.  When they had
admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc
and slew a larger number of them in one day than the Kite could
pounce upon in a whole year.  
Avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease.  
The Widow and the Sheep 
A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep.  At shearing time,
wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him
herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece
she sheared the flesh.  The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, "Why
do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood add to the
wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who will kill
me in an instant; but if you want my fleece and wool, there is
the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me."  
The least outlay is not always the greatest gain.  
The Wild Ass and the Lion 
A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they might
capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease.  The Lion
agreed to assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the Wild
Ass gave the Lion the benefit of his greater speed.  When they
had taken as many beasts as their necessities required, the Lion
undertook to distribute the prey, and for this purpose divided it
into three shares.  "I will take the first share," he said,
"because I am King:  and the second share, as a partner with you
in the chase:  and the third share (believe me) will be a source
of great evil to you, unless you willingly resign it to me, and
set off as fast as you can."  
Might makes right.  
The Eagle and the Arrow 
AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare
whom he sought to make his prey.  An archer, who saw the Eagle
from a place of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him
mortally.  The Eagle gave one look at the arrow that had entered
his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had
been furnished by himself.  "It is a double grief to me," he
exclaimed, "that I should perish by an arrow feathered from my
own wings."  
The Sick Kite 
A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother:  "O Mother! do not
mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be
prolonged."  She replied, "Alas! my son, which of the gods do you
think will pity you? Is there one whom you have not outraged by
filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice offered
up to them?'  
We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in
adversity.  
The Lion and the Dolphin 
A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out
of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance,
saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends,
since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other
was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean.  The
Dolphin gladly consented to this request.  Not long afterwards
the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin
to help him.  The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him
assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means
reach the land.  The Lion abused him as a traitor.  The Dolphin
replied, "Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while
giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the
power of living upon the land."  
The Lion and the Boar 
ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst
among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a
small well to drink.  They fiercely disputed which of them should
drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal
combat.  When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a
fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting in
the distance to feast on the one that should fall first.  They at
once made up their quarrel, saying, "It is better for us to make
friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures."  
The One-Eyed Doe 
A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the
edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing
her greater safety.  She turned her sound eye towards the land
that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter
or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she
entertained no anticipation of danger.  Some boatmen sailing by
saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. 
Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament:  "O
wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the
land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come
for safety, so much more perilous."  
The Shepherd and the Sea 
A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw the
Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a view
to commerce.  He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo of
dates, and set sail.  But a very great tempest came on, and the
ship being in danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise
overboard, and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship. 
Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the
unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, "It is
again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet."  
The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion 
AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion,
desperate from hunger, approached the spot.  He was about to
spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice
the Lion, it is said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and
the Lion fled away as fast as he could.  The Ass, observing his
trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock summoned courage to
attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose.  He had run
no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and
tore him to pieces.  
False confidence often leads into danger.  
The Mice and the Weasels 
THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other,
in which much blood was shed.  The Weasels were always the
victors.  The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent
defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general
army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from
lack of discipline.  They therefore chose as leaders Mice that
were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and
counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the
fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and
formed into troops, regiments, and battalions.  When all this was
done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly
proclaimed war by challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen
generals bound their heads with straws, that they might be more
conspicuous to all their troops.  Scarcely had the battle begun,
when a great rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast
as they could to their holes.  The generals, not being able to
get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all
captured and eaten by the Weasels.  
The more honor the more danger.  
The Mice in Council 
THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best devise
means of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy
the Cat.  Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most
favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat, so
that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling, might
run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach.  But
when the Mice further debated who among them should thus "bell
the Cat," there was no one found to do it.  
The Wolf and the Housedog 
A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about
his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet
compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went. 
"The master," he replied.  Then said the Wolf:  "May no friend of
mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of this chain is
enough to spoil the appetite."  
The Rivers and the Sea 
THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, "Why
is it that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you
work in us such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?"
The Sea, perceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him,
said, "Pray cease to flow into me, and then you will not be made
briny."  
The Playful Ass 
AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about
there, broke in the tiling.  The owner went up after him and
quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden
cudgel.  The Ass said, "Why, I saw the Monkey do this very thing
yesterday, and you all laughed heartily, as if it afforded you
very great amusement."  
The Three Tradesmen 
A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called
together to consider the best means of protecting it from the
enemy.  A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording
the best material for an effective resistance.  A Carpenter, with
equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable method of
defense.  Upon which a Currier stood up and said, "Sirs, I differ
from you altogether:  there is no material for resistance equal to
a covering of hides; and nothing so good as leather."  
Every man for himself.  
The Master and His Dogs 
A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first of
all killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance of
his household.  The storm still continuing, he was obliged to
slaughter his yoke oxen for food.  On seeing this, his Dogs took
counsel together, and said, "It is time for us to be off, for if
the master spare not his oxen, who work for his gain, how can we
expect him to spare us?'  
He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family. 
The Wolf and the Shepherds 
A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a haunch
of mutton for their dinner.  Approaching them, he said, "What a
clamor you would raise if I were to do as you are doing!"  
The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat 
THE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other.  When
the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of the
waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they
would accept him as an umpire.  One of the Dolphins replied, "We
would far rather be destroyed in our battle with each other than
admit any interference from you in our affairs."  
The Ass Carrying the Image 
AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden
Image, to be placed in one of its Temples.  As he passed along,
the crowd made lowly prostration before the Image.  The Ass,
thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for
himself, bristled up with pride, gave himself airs, and refused
to move another step.  The driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his
whip lustily about his shoulders and said, "O you perverse
dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an
Ass."  
They are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to
others.  
The Two Travelers and the Axe 
TWO MEN were journeying together.  One of them picked up an axe
that lay upon the path, and said, "I have found an axe."  "Nay, my
friend," replied the other, "do not say 'I,' but 'We' have found
an axe."  They had not gone far before they saw the owner of the
axe pursuing them, and he who had picked up the axe said, "We are
undone."  "Nay," replied the other, "keep to your first mode of
speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right now. 
Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone."  
He who shares the danger ought to share the prize.  
The Old Lion 
A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on
the ground at the point of death.  A Boar rushed upon him, and
avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury. 
Shortly afterwards the Bull with his horns gored him as if he
were an enemy.  When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be
assailed with impunity, he let drive at his forehead with his
heels.  The expiring Lion said, "I have reluctantly brooked the
insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such
treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a
double death."  
The Old Hound 
A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never
yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a
boar in the chase.  He seized him boldly by the ear, but could
not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that
the boar escaped.  His master, quickly coming up, was very much
disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog.  The Hound looked up
and said, "It was not my fault.  master:  my spirit was as good as
ever, but I could not help my infirmities.  I rather deserve to
be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I
am."  
The Bee and Jupiter 
A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to
Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. 
Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to give
whatever she should ask.  She therefore besought him, saying,
"Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if any mortal shall approach
to take my honey, I may kill him."  Jupiter was much displeased,
for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse the request
because of his promise.  He thus answered the Bee:  "You shall
have your request, but it will be at the peril of your own life. 
For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make,
and then you will die from the loss of it."  
Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.  
The Milk-Woman and Her Pail 
A FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field
to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing.  "The money for which
this milk will be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. 
The eggs, allowing for all mishaps, will produce two hundred and
fifty chickens.  The chickens will become ready for the market
when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that by the end of
the year I shall have money enough from my share to buy a new
gown.  In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where
all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head
and refuse them every one."  At this moment she tossed her head in
unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the
ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.  
The Seaside Travelers 
SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the
summit of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the
distance what they thought was a large ship.  They waited in the
hope of seeing it enter the harbor, but as the object on which
they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind, they found
that it could at the most be a small boat, and not a ship.  When
however it reached the beach, they discovered that it was only a
large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions,
"We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing to
see but a load of wood."  
Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.  
The Brazier and His Dog 
A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his
master, and his constant companion.  While he hammered away at
his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to
dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as
if he would ask for a share of his meal.  His master one day,
pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said, "You
wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am
hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin to
eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food.  Do
you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that
none but those who work are entitled to eat?'  
The Ass and His Shadow 
A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place.  The
day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the
Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under
the Shadow of the Ass.  As this afforded only protection for one,
and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a
violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the
right to the Shadow.  The owner maintained that he had let the
Ass only, and not his Shadow.  The Traveler asserted that he had,
with the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also.  The quarrel
proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass
galloped off.  
In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.  
The Ass and His Masters 
AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little food
and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released from
his present service and provided with another master.  Jupiter,
after warning him that he would repent his request, caused him to
be sold to a tile-maker.  Shortly afterwards, finding that he had
heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he
petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter, telling him
that it would be the last time that he could grant his request,
ordained that he be sold to a tanner.  The Ass found that he had
fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's occupation,
said, groaning:  "It would have been better for me to have been
either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the
other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my
present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and
make me useful to him."  
The Oak and the Reeds 
A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a
stream.  It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed:  "I
wonder how you, who are so light and weak, are not entirely
crushed by these strong winds."  They replied, "You fight and
contend with the wind, and consequently you are destroyed; while
we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air, and
therefore remain unbroken, and escape."  
Stoop to conquer.  
The Fisherman and the Little Fish 
A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught
a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor.  The Fish,
panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life:  "O Sir, what
good can I be to you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet
come to my full size.  Pray spare my life, and put me back into
the sea.  I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of
the rich, and then you can catch me again, and make a handsome
profit of me."  The Fisherman replied, "I should indeed be a very
simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I
were to forego my present certain gain."  
The Hunter and the Woodman 
A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. 
He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any
marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was.  "I will,"
said the man, "at once show you the Lion himself."  The Hunter,
turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear,
replied, "No, thank you.  I did not ask that; it is his track
only I am in search of, not the Lion himself."  
The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.  
The Wild Boar and the Fox 
A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the
trunk.  A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his
teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman
or hound.  He replied, "I do it advisedly; for it would never do
to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time I ought to be
using them."  
The Lion in a Farmyard 
A LION entered a farmyard.  The Farmer, wishing to catch him,
shut the gate.  When the Lion found that he could not escape, he
flew upon the sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen. 
The Farmer, beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened
the gate and released the Lion.  On his departure the Farmer
grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but
his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took place, said,
"On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for a
moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your
farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only
hear his roar at a distance?'  
Mercury and the Sculptor 
MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held among
mortals.  For this purpose he assumed the character of a man and
visited in this disguise a Sculptor's studio having looked at
various statues, he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter
and Juno.  When the sum at which they were valued was named, he
pointed to a figure of himself, saying to the Sculptor, "You will
certainly want much more for this, as it is the statue of the
Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain."  The
Sculptor replied, "Well, if you will buy these, I'll fling you
that into the bargain."  
The Swan and the Goose 
A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan.  He
fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its
song.  When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to
get him at night, when it was dark, and he was not able to
distinguish one bird from the other.  By mistake he caught the
Swan instead of the Goose.  The Swan, threatened with death,
burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice,
and preserved his life by his melody.  
The Swollen Fox 
A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds
in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty
meal.  When he finished, he was so full that he was not able to
get out, and began to groan and lament his fate.  Another Fox
passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of
his complaining.  On learning what had happened, he said to him,
"Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, until you become
such as you were when you crept in, and then you will easily get
out."  
The Fox and the Woodcutter 
A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter
felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place. 
The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the
Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner.  The huntsman soon came
up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen
the Fox.  He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed,
all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay
hidden.  The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing
his word, hastened forward in the chase.  As soon as they were
well away, the Fox departed without taking any notice of the
Woodcutter:  whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying,
"You ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you
leave me without a word of thanks."  The Fox replied, "Indeed, I
should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good
as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your
speech."  
The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock 
A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a
friend unexpectedly came in.  The bird-trap was quite empty, as
he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which
he had tamed for a decoy.  The bird entreated earnestly for his
life:  "What would you do without me when next you spread your
nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for you the covey of
answering birds?'  The Birdcatcher spared his life, and determined
to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to his comb.  But
the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch:  "If you
kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? 
Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time
to visit the bird-trap in the morning?'  He replied, "What you say
is true.  You are a capital bird at telling the time of day.  But
my friend and I must have our dinners."  
Necessity knows no law.  
The Monkey and the Fishermen 
A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting
their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. 
The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to
dinner left their nets upon the bank.  The Monkey, who is the
most imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and
endeavored to do as they had done.  Having handled the net, he
threw it into the river, but became tangled in the meshes and
drowned.  With his last breath he said to himself, "I am rightly
served; for what business had I who had never handled a net to
try and catch fish?'  
The Flea and the Wrestler 
A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him,
causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help.  When the
Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, "O
Hercules! if you will not help me against a Flea, how can I hope
for your assistance against greater antagonists?'  
The Two Frogs 
TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool.  When the pool dried up under
the summer's heat, they left it and set out together for another
home.  As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply
supplied with water, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs said
to the other, "Let us descend and make our abode in this well:  it
will furnish us with shelter and food."  The other replied with
greater caution, "But suppose the water should fail us.  How can
we get out again from so great a depth?'  
Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.  
The Cat and the Mice 
A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice.  A Cat, discovering this,
made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. 
Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their
holes.  The Cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived
that she must tempt them forth by some device.  For this purpose
she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended
to be dead.  One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and
said, "Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a
meal-bag, we will not come near you."  
The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox 
A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought
fiercely for its possession.  When they had fearfully lacerated
each other and were faint from the long combat, they lay down
exhausted with fatigue.  A Fox, who had gone round them at a
distance several times, saw them both stretched on the ground
with the Kid lying untouched in the middle.  He ran in between
them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could.  The
Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said,
"Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored ourselves
only to serve the turn of a Fox."  
It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another
all the profit.  
The Doe and the Lion 
A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging
to a Lion.  The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach,
but when she was safe within the cave, sprang upon her and tore
her to pieces.  "Woe is me," exclaimed the Doe, "who have escaped
from man, only to throw myself into the mouth of a wild beast?'  
In avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into
another.  
The Farmer and the Fox 
A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry
yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take an ample
revenge, tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set
it on fire.  The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields
of the Farmer who had captured him.  It was the time of the wheat
harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year and returned
home grieving sorely.  
The Seagull and the Kite 
A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep
gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die.  A Kite saw him and
exclaimed:  "You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air
has no business to seek its food from the sea."  
Every man should be content to mind his own business.  
The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury 
A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel,
of which the crew and passengers were all drowned.  He inveighed
against the injustice of Providence, which would for the sake of
one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent
persons to perish.  As he was indulging in these reflections, he
found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants, near whose nest
he was standing.  One of them climbed up and stung him, and he
immediately trampled them all to death with his foot.  Mercury
presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his wand,
said, "And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the
dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner
treated these poor Ants?'  
The Mouse and the Bull 
A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to
capture him.  But the Mouse reached his hole in safety.  Though
the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he
could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep
outside the hole.  The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his
flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole.  The Bull
rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed.  At
which the Mouse said, "The great do not always prevail.  There
are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do
mischief."  
The Lion and the Hare 
A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep.  He was just in
the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he
left the Hare to follow him.  The Hare, scared by the noise,
awoke and scudded away.  The Lion was unable after a long chase
to catch the Hart, and returned to feed upon the Hare.  On
finding that the Hare also had run off, he said, "I am rightly
served, for having let go of the food that I had in my hand for
the chance of obtaining more."  
The Peasant and the Eagle 
A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring
the bird, set him free.  The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to
his deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which
was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a
bundle from his head.  When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the
Eagle let the bundle fall again.  Taking it up, the man returned
to the same place, to find that the wall under which he had been
sitting had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service
rendered him by the Eagle.  
The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter 
A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of
Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and begged
the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he
became poorer and poorer.  At last, being very angry, he took his
image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall. 
When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which
the Carpenter quickly picked up and said, "Well, I think thou art
altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you
honor, I reaped no benefits:  but now that I maltreat you I am
loaded with an abundance of riches."  
The Bull and the Goat 
A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds
had recently occupied.  As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in
the cave sharply attacked him with his horns.  The Bull quietly
addressed him:  "Butt away as much as you will.  I have no fear of
you, but of the Lion.  Let that monster go away and I will soon
let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a
Bull."  
It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in
distress.  
The Dancing Monkeys 
A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance.  Being naturally
great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt
pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they
danced as well as any of the courtiers.  The spectacle was often
repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier,
bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts and
threw them upon the stage.  The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts
forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys
instead of actors.  Pulling off their masks and tearing their
robes, they fought with one another for the nuts.  The dancing
spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of
the audience.  
The Fox and the Leopard 
THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of
the two.  The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots
which decorated his skin.  But the Fox, interrupting him, said,
"And how much more beautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not
in body, but in mind."  
The Monkeys and Their Mother 
THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth.  The
Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection
and care, but hates and neglects the other.  It happened once
that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by
the too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one was
nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was
exposed.  
The best intentions will not always ensure success.  
The Oaks and Jupiter 
THE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, "We bear for
no purpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that grow we
are the most continually in peril of the axe."  Jupiter made
answer:  "You have only to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to
which you are exposed:  for if you did not make such excellent
pillars and posts, and prove yourselves so serviceable to the
carpenters and the farmers, the axe would not so frequently be
laid to your roots."  
The Hare and the Hound 
A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run, gave
up the chase.  A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him, saying
"The little one is the best runner of the two."  The Hound
replied, "You do not see the difference between us:  I was only
running for a dinner, but he for his life."  
The Traveler and Fortune 
A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with
fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well.  Just as he was about
to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him
and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him:  "Good Sir,
pray wake up:  for if you fall into the well, the blame will be
thrown on me, and I shall get an ill name among mortals; for I
find that men are sure to impute their calamities to me, however
much by their own folly they have really brought them on
themselves."  
Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.  
The Bald Knight 
A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt.  A sudden puff
of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang
forth from his companions.  He pulled up his horse, and with
great glee joined in the joke by saying, "What a marvel it is
that hairs which are not mine should fly from me, when they have
forsaken even the man on whose head they grew."  
The Shepherd and the Dog 
A SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about
to shut up a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the wolf
said, "Master, how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you
admit a wolf into the fold?'  
The Lamp 
A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted
that it gave more light than the sun.  Then a sudden puff of wind
arose, and the Lamp was immediately extinguished.  Its owner lit
it again, and said:  "Boast no more, but henceforth be content to
give thy light in silence.  Know that not even the stars need to
be relit" 
The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass 
THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist
each other in the chase.  Having secured a large booty, the Lion
on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due
portion to each of the three partners in the treaty.  The Ass
carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly
requested the two others to make the first choice.  The Lion,
bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass.  Then he
requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division.  The
Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and
left to himself the smallest possible morsel.  The Lion said,
"Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of
division? You are perfect to a fraction."  He replied, "I learned
it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate."  
Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.  
The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter 
A BULL finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death with his
horns.  The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the death of
her whelp.  A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress, stood at a
distance and said to her, "Think how many men there are who have
reason to lament the loss of their children, whose deaths have
been caused by you."  
The Oak and the Woodcutters 
THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces,
making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk.  The
Oak said with a sigh, "I do not care about the blows of the axe
aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by
these wedges made from my own branches."  
Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.  
The Hen and the Golden Eggs 
A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every
day.  They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of
gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it. 
Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen
differed in no respect from their other hens.  The foolish pair,
thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of
the gain of which they were assured day by day.  
The Ass and the Frogs 
AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond.  As he
was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and
fell, and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned
heavily.  Some Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation,
and said, "What would you do if you had to live here always as we
do, when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water?"
Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do
large misfortunes.  
The Crow and the Raven 
A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a bird
of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who noted
by his flight the good or evil course of future events.  Seeing
some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree, and
perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as she
could.  The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what
it foreboded, when one of them said to his companion, "Let us
proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a
crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen."  
Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, only
make themselves ridiculous.  
The Trees and the Axe 
A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a
handle for his axe.  The Trees consented to his request and gave
him a young ash-tree.  No sooner had the man fitted a new handle
to his axe from it, than he began to use it and quickly felled
with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest.  An old oak,
lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said
to a neighboring cedar, "The first step has lost us all.  If we
had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have
retained our own privileges and have stood for ages."  
The Crab and the Fox 
A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green meadow
as its feeding ground.  A Fox came across him, and being very
hungry ate him up.  Just as he was on the point of being eaten,
the Crab said, "I well deserve my fate, for what business had I
on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only adapted for
the sea?'  
Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness.  
The Woman and Her Hen 
A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day.  She
often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of
one, and at last, to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen
a double allowance of barley.  From that day the Hen became fat
and sleek, and never once laid another egg.  
The Ass and the Old Shepherd 
A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all
of a sudden by the cries of the enemy.  He appealed to the Ass to
fly with him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal
lazily replied, "Why should I, pray? Do you think it likely the
conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?'  "No," rejoined
the Shepherd.  "Then," said the Ass, "as long as I carry the
panniers, what matters it to me whom I serve?'  
In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name
of their master.  
The Kites and the Swans 
TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege
of song.  But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so
enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in
trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.  
The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of
present blessings.  
The Wolves and the Sheepdogs 
THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs:  "Why should you, who are
like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind with us,
and live with us as brothers should? We differ from you in one
point only.  We live in freedom, but you bow down to and slave
for men, who in return for your services flog you with whips and
put collars on your necks.  They make you also guard their sheep,
and while they eat the mutton throw only the bones to you.  If
you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the sheep, and we
will enjoy them in common, till we all are surfeited."  The Dogs
listened favorably to these proposals, and, entering the den of
the Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.  
The Hares and the Foxes 
THE HARES waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the Foxes to
help them.  They replied, "We would willingly have helped you, if
we had not known who you were, and with whom you were fighting."
Count the cost before you commit yourselves.  
The Bowman and Lion 
A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game,
but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach.  The Lion
alone challenged him to combat.  The Bowman immediately shot out
an arrow and said to the Lion:  "I send thee my messenger, that
from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I assail
thee."  The wounded Lion rushed away in great fear, and when a Fox
who had seen it all happen told him to be of good courage and not
to back off at the first attack he replied:  "You counsel me in
vain; for if he sends so fearful a messenger, how shall I abide
the attack of the man himself?'  
Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance.  
The Camel 
WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast
size that he ran away.  After a time, perceiving the meekness and
gentleness of the beast's temper, he summoned courage enough to
approach him.  Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal
altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to
put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him.  
Use serves to overcome dread.  
The Wasp and the Snake 
A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking him
unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death.  The Snake,
being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his
enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and
purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, "At least my
