    "Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged
  twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten
  o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was
  dressed in --
etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel
needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
  "Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what
the girl said."
  "Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing
should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,
every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
Eyford."
  Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon
the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with
Eyford for its centre.
  "There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
ten miles from the village. The place we want must be some-
where near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
  "It was an hour's good drive."
  "And you think that they brought you back all that way when
you were unconscious?"
  "They must have done so.l have a confused memory, too, of
having been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
  "What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should
have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the
garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's
entreaties."
  "I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
in my life."
  "Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well,
I have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point
upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
  "I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
  "Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it
is south, for the country is more deserted there."
  "And I say east," said my patient.
  "I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are
several quiet little villages up there."
  "And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills
there, and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go
up any."
  "Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty
diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us.
Who do you give your casting vote to?"
  "You are all wrong."
  "But we can't all be."
  "Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in
the centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
  "But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
  "Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that
the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be
that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
  "Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
of this gang."
  "None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large
scale, and have used the machine to form the amalgam which
has taken the place of silver."
  "We have known for some time that a clever gang was at
work," said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-
crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading,
but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a
way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks
to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
  But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
  "A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way.
  "Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
  "When did it break out?"
  "I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,
and the whole place is in a blaze."
  "Whose house is it?"
  "Dr. Becher's."
  "Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German,
very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
  The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is
an Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
bener-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,
a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if
a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
  The station-master had not finished his speech before we were
all hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep
the flames under.
  "That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is
the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That
second window is the one that I jumped from."
  "Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge
upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp
which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden
walls, though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after
you to observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this
crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that
they are a good hundred miles off by now."
  And Holmes's fears came to be realized, for from that day to
this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman,
the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morn-
ing a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some
very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes's
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts.
  The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrange-
ments which they had found within, and still more so by discov-
ering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the
second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last
successful, and they subdued the flames, but not before the roof
had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to such absolute
ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a
trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate
acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were
discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be
found, which may have explained the presence of those bulky
boxes which have been already referred to.
  How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the
garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have
remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which
told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by
two persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the
other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable
that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous
than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear the uncon-
scious man out of the way of danger.
  "Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to
return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for
me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and
what have I gained?"
  "Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be
of value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain
the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of
your exlstence."

Well, since my offer of this list of translations, I've gotten
several requests, so I decided to just post it and save everyone
(including myself :-)  ) lots of time.  So, without further ado,
I present the list of enya translations.  It was originally 
posted by Lyle Corbin.

   You asked this (common) question at just the right time, since I was just
   ready to post this to USENET.
   Please send me comments & etc.

    English Translations of _The Celts_, _Watermark_, and _Shepherd Moons_.
  ===========================================================================
    The following is a compilation of translations taken primarily from
    USENET postings.  In the cases where multiple translations existed, I
    tried to pick the phrases that made the most (English) sense, and which
    flowed together the best.  The choice was often arbitrary, and not
    being a speaker of Irish (or Gaelic), Latin, or Welsh, I was not able
    to make my own judgements regarding the accuracy of translation.  Your
    comments, suggestions, and corrections are welcome.  Some of the songs
    have the lyrics compacted, where repeated phrases are only listed once.
    There are several songs, such as Ebudae, where when listening to the
    song it sounds like lyrics beyond what's printed are being sung.  If
    anyone is willing to transcribe any such lyrics (and, possibly,
    translate) then send them to me for inclusion into this document.
    Please be sure to send me both the original language text (with accents
    (fada) as appropriate) and the translation if you do.  (Information
    telling me that there is nothing there to translate would be useful too.)
    Finally, if anyone has editions of songs which were released on singles
    only, (i.e. not translated here) then feel free to send me transcriptions
    and translations for those as well.
    Enjoy!

 Dawn breaks; there is blue in the sky.
 Your face before me though I don't know why.
 Thoughts disappearing like tears from the moon.
 Waiting here; as I sit by the stone
 They came before me, those men from the sun.
 Signs from the heavens say I am the one.
 Chorus
 Now I know; I can see your light,
 this light that I must follow,
 You -- you could take my life away
                   -- so far away.
 Now I know; I must leave your spell
                   -- I want tomorrow.

  sleeve of the Japanese pressing by Jimco Records: following are the

 Notes:
 (1) Samhna is a version of Samhan which is the name given to the first day
     of November.  This day was a very large feast in pagan, esp. Celtic,
     tradition.  Indeed, the Irish word for November is Samhain.  It was
     one of the most important festivals of the year.  Oiche Samhna is the
     Irish for Halloween.  (Aidan Hollinshead)

  --------------------------- CURSUM PERFICIO -------------------------------
 Cursum perficio                 I complete my journey (or my path)
 Verbum sapienti                 The word of the wise
 Quo plus habent                 The more they have [of it]              (1)
 Eo plus cupiunt                 The more they want [it]
 Post nubila, Phoebus            After the clouds, Phoebus [the god Sun] (2)
 Iternum                         (3)
Notes:
(1) My guess is that the thing "they" want in the 3rd and 4th lines is in fact
    the 'word of the wise' mentioned in the 2nd line, which, by the way, would
    also be in the correct case of the declination.
(2) Phoebus was one of the names for the Sun god, which may be more famous as
    Apollo (Greek). It is notable that the Sun is a male.
(3) The word 'iternum' does not exist; it could either be a misspelling for
    'eternum' (eternal), which is unlikely since it is very rare that an
    adjective be used as an adverb, or for 'iterum' (again and again) which is
    in fact an adverb and makes a little more sense (!!).
Finally, the meaning of 'cursum perficio' is actually best explained by the
footnote to the lyrics: Enya was inspired by these words she saw on Marylin
Monroe's last house, where they were taken to mean "my journey ends here".
It is a rather "free" translation, but it's probably a very good way to convey
the meaning of Latin, which has a way of saying things that is very distant
from modern-day English. The fact that those words turned out to be
prophetical only adds to the power of the song.

  ----------------------- HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING? ----------------------
A verse is missing from the printed words on "How Can I Keep From Singing?"
The lyrics are all correct except after the second verse ("Through all the
   tumult and the strife...") add this verse:
                  While though the tempest loudly roars,
                  I hear the truth it liveth.
                  And though the darkness 'round me close,
                  Songs in the night it giveth.
                  No storm can shake my in-most calm
                  While to that rock I'm clinging.
                  Since Love is Lord of heaven and earth,
                  How can I keep from singing?
     Transcription by Jagg Groeg (crow@mundil.cs.mu.oz.au)
     (But you can get the words just by listening carefully!)
  Note:  There are several words that are a bit difficult to determine
          exactly what they are, but Jagg points out (and I agree) that
          of the possibilities, the ones here make the most sense. - Lyle

Notes:
"Ebudae" is a term that deals with sounds.
The last line seems to contain a misprint, since the phrase is definitely
  "anonn is anall", not "annon ...".  (Aidan Hollinshead)

  --------------------- BOOK OF DAYS (English Version) ----------------------
                     One day, one night, one moment
                     My dreams could be tomorrow
                     One step, one fall, one falter
                     East or West,
                     Over earth or by ocean
                     One way to be my journey
                     This way could be my
                        Book of Days
                     No day, no night, no moment
                     Can hold me back from trying
                     One flag, one fall, one falter
                     I'll find my day maybe
                          Far and Away
                          Far and Away
                     One day, one night one moment
                     With a dream to be leaving
                     One step, one fall, one falter
                     Find a new world across a wide ocean
                     This way became my journey
                     This day brings together
                          Far and Away
                     This day brings together
                          Far and Away
                          Far and Away.

Mememto, vita brevis.            Remember, life is brief.
Meus mihi, suus cuique carus.    Mine to me, its own to each is dear.
Notes:
(1) Proper names I'm guessing--Umbriel, Ariel, Io, Vela.
(2) This is tough. "itur" is a poetic form, apparently.  The phrase
    may mean "without end" or "eternal". (Larry)
    'Et itur ad astra' means 'And we go to the stars'.  There is no way of
    putting into English the "impersonal" meaning of 'itur' which is actually
    the third person singular of the passive indicative present tense (sorry,
    but I do not really know how English scholars refer to tenses, hope it's
    clear enough) of the verb 'ire' which means 'to go'.  Since 'to go' cannot
    possibly be passive (I am gone?) the passive mode is taken to sound as
    done by everybody and nobody in particular at the same time, really like
    something that gets done but without specifying by whom. (Mauro)
    This phrase has been bothering me for some time - I was sure I'd seen it
    or something like it before.  Eventually I found it.  There is a phrase in
    Virgil's Aeniad which reads 'sic itur ad astra' which the translator noted
    as having the literal meaning 'thus you shall go to the stars' but the
    poetic, metaphorical meaning 'thus is immortality gained'.  So
    substituting 'et' (and, also) for 'sic' (thus, therefore) the translation
    might read along the lines of 'and you shall go to the stars' or, perhaps,
    'and you shall live forever'.  (Unknown)
(3) 'Vela' refers to a boat's sail.  It may well be a proper name, though.
        (Mauro)
(4) "mirabilia" (neuter plural) means literally "marvellous things";
    translated as the singular and differently--English likes to vary.
(5) "sempervirent" == "evergreen".
(6) I don't know how to translate "Rosetum"--a proper name or "rose garden", 
	which seems unlikely.
(7) Zephyrus is a warm west wind.
(8) Volturnus is a "river(?) in Campania", according to Cassell's Latin
    dictionary.  I don't understand the reference.
(9) Africus is the south-west storm-rain wind.
(10) The Etesians are winds that blow 40 days each year around
     the "dog days".
     "Etesiarum" is a general term for swirling winds "tease"ing each other.
     Eurus is the East wind; hence "Europe." NOTE--In Carribean Blue, the
     wind "Boreas" is mentioned; it refers to the North Wind; hence the
     Aurora Borealis.  (Graham)
(11) Eurus is the south-east wind.
(12) This is almost impossible to translate into English without doing
     damage to word order.  "mine is dear to me, its/his/her own is
     dear to each."
(13) "terrigena" is literally "earth-born creature," formed from the word
     for land, "terra", and race or kind, "genus." (Graham)
 --  It is apparent that most of Enya's Latin lyrics have been influenced
     by Virgil's Aeneid, since many of her phrases are those used by Virgil.

  A Relevant Excerpt from "The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of 
               Death", by Daniel Manus Pinkwater.  
    "Walter!  Come see what I've got!" said my father.
    What he had was an avocado.  Whenever he brings one home, which is
 fairly often, he makes a big fuss about it.
    "Looky, Walter, an avocado!  What do you think of it?"  My father
 is the only person I know who says "looky!"  He also says "lookit!"
    What I think of avocados is this: On principle, I do not eat
 green, slimy things,  My mother doesn't eat them either.  She says
 she doesn't like the taste of avocado.  That's good enough for me.
 If there's any question at all about the taste, I'm leaving those
 suckers alone.
    My father loves them.  Every time he brings one home, he acts like
 it's a three-hundred-pound sailfish he's caught singlehanded, or an
 elk he brought down with a bow and arrow.
    He's really enthusiastic about avocados.  He skins them and digs
 out that oversized, stupid-looking pit, and then mashes up the slimy
 green part with a fork.  Then he puts lemon juice and vinegar, salt
 and pepper, and powdered garlic and paprika on it.  Of you have to go
 to all that trouble to disguise the flavor, why bother, I say.
    Then he makes a speech about it.  "My goodness, this is one fine
 avocado," he says.  "You have to know how to choose them.  You have
 to look for the ones that are black and blasted looking.  The pretty
 green ones aren't fit to eat.  The funny thing is that they reduce
 the price of the really scrumptious ones just because they're ugly.
 I guess they want to sell them before they rot completely."
    My father isn't a bad guy, in my opinion.  There are just a few
 subjects, like avocados, on which he's irrational.
    My mother had found another tuna-casserole recipe.  This is
 something of a hobby with her.  She's constantly finding these
 recipes in women's magazines.  She tries another one at least once a
 week.  They all taste like tuna fish.  Usually the have things in
 them you wouldn't expect to eat with tuna fish - like grapes, hot-
 pickle slices, fried Chinese noodles.
    "I hope you will appreciate this, kiddo," my mother says, "seeing
 that your mother took a healthy slice out of her finger whilst
 chopping up the ingredients."  She usually manages to injure herself
 at least once while preparing a meal.  She has a Band-Aid on her
 finger.
    "Eat up, champ," she says.  "It's American."  My mother has an
 idea that tuna caught in Japanese waters is tainted with
 radioactivity, so she always shops for brands canned within the
 continental United States.  Even Canadian brands are out.  "They're
 too chummy with the Commonists," she says.  She calls Communists
 "Commonists."
    If you were blind, or only knew my mother from talking with her on
 the telephone, you'd probably think she was about six feet tall...and
 maybe two hundred and fifty pounds in weight.  It's her voice, and
 the way she talks.  She sounds like she ought to be a big, slow-
 moving person, maybe a little sloppy.  Actually, she's small and
 nervous, always well dressed, and a chain smoker.  Once my father and
 I have started eating our meal, she brings a little ashtray to the
 table and puffs a cigarette between bites of food.  This is far more
 disgusting than avocado eating.  If I can possibly get out of it, I
 try not to have meals with my parents.  I've complained to them about
 various nauseating things they do, but it doesn't do any good.
 "Everybody has a family," my mother says.  I don't know what that
 means.
    Our apartment is new.  We are the first people ever to live in it.
 When we first moved into the building, it wasn't quite finished.  The
 whole place smelled of paint, and there was brown paper on the floors
 in the elevator and the hallways.  In those days, we had to take our
 shoes off outside the the apartment door so we wouldn't track plaster
 dust onto the carpet.
    Come to think of it, I've never walked on the floor in our living
 room.  There are those clear plastic runners my mother put down,
 making a kind of path through the living room to the dining alcove.
 The furniture has plastic covers, too.  My mother says that when you
 decorate with light colors, you have to be careful.  Nobody ever sits
 in the living room, except when my parents have company - and then it
 has to be company wearing suits and ties, and fancy dresses.  When
 they expect company like that, my father puts on a suit and tie, and
 my mother puts on a fancy dress and rolls up the plastic runners, and
 the all sit in the living room.  I get called in to be introduced to
 the company.  I always stand at the edge of the living-room carpet.
 The company says, "I understand you're a fine young man," or, "He
 looks like a football player.  Are you a football player?"  I'm at
 least a foot too short to be a football player.  Besides which, I
 hate football.
    "Yes," I say, "I'm a football player."  This happens -having
 company in the living room - about twice a year.  The rest of the
 time, nobody sits there.
    When regular people - relatives and such - come over, everybody
 sits in the den.  The den has a linoleum floor.  Sometimes my father
 sits around in his undershirt.  When he's feeling funny, he gets
 Nosferatu, my parakeet, and gets him to sit on his head.  Apparently,
 Nosferatu likes him.  He'll sit on my father's head for an hour.

My dearest,
     Finally, my semi-annual allotment of message units has
arrived.  Will I be glad when this expedition is over!  It has
been the most frustating, unproductive and unpublishable field
experience of my career.  The Tlaidas are the most self-
contained, taciturn, and uncommunicative people I have ever
encountered.  We have been on this god-forsaken arid rock for
over two years and have not seen any evidence of ritual or
religous thought.  A culture devoid of the metaphysical impulse
is beyond my comprehension and, indeed, would run counter to all
known theories of societal development.
     Well, all may not be lost.  Recently, I did learn that the
Tlaidas possess a philosophy of sorts, whose principles are
embodied in a series of Fables.  Needless to say, they would not
elaborate and would certainly not condescend to tell a thoroughly
frustated Terran anthropologist a tale or two.  Then, just this
past week, an event occurred which might be the beginning of a
breakthrough.  Last night, Antaanak, my one and only friend among
the Tlaidas knocked on the door shortly after the second moon had
set and asked if he could talk to me.  He looked sad and upset as
he thrust a worn, rolled manuscript into my hands.  He said it
was a Fable and he wished it transported off planet for perusal,
enjoyment and study.  Antaanak believes that if the Tlaidas have
anything to give to other peoples, it is their Fables.  They
possess no sculptural or pictorial art, no mineral wealth and
only the most rudimentary of technologies.  The violent dust
storms, which are almost a nightly occurrence here during the
summer, forced Antaanak to wait until dawn before leaving. 
     After thrusting the parchment into my hands and making me
swear eternal oaths not to reveal the means by which I came to
own it, he lapsed into gloomy silence.  Apparently, it is a crime
punishable by torture and mutilation to give or tell a Fable to
an offworlder.  Antaanak's is convinced that the Tlaidas must end
their self imposed, eon-old isolation and begin to communicate
the only thing they have of any value and so he has exposed
himself to enormous risk.  He has committed the most heinous
crime of his culture.  Antaanak is mortally afraid that if the
Tlaidas persist in their ways, they will slowly, irrevokably rot
from narcissistic, fear-ridden egocentricity until they are
totally consumed by fear, hatred and madness.  I agree
completely. 
     To think that such noble hands may have provided me with the
opportunity to achieve tenure at the University!  Guard this old
manscript with your life, my dear, your very life!
     I miss you more than words can convey. Unitl we meet, may
the tears of Earth stain the stars forever.
                              With boundless love,
          
                                                  Arik

                             THE FABLE
     Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away from here, there
lived a king.  This king was good man and he ruled his realm on a
sun drenched, but fertile planet, with fairness, justice and
love.  His peasants were truly free men and women.  They laughed
and sang and their crops were lush and bountiful.  The women of
the land were famed for their beauty, intelligence, smiles and
happy, healthy children.  Peace was upon the land and had been so
long as the king had ruled, which was as long as anyone could
remember.  No enemies from within, without or above trouble this
fair land.  The king maintained no army and few soldiers.  His
several knights seemed jovial and good natured fellows who spent
most of their time pulling carts and wagons from ditches, helping
old men and women draw water from the well, and teaching young
boys and girls how to use the bow and hunt.
     But it was apparent to all that the king was not happy.  In
contrast to his subjects, he was never observed to smile or
laugh.  Almost daily accompanied by some of his knights, he would
visit a village or field and inquire of those he met about their
hopes, failures, successes and expectations.  His polite manner
was never aloof or condescending, but was noticeably  reserved
and somewhat cold.  The impression that he left upon his subjects
was not that he did not care for them, but that he carried a
sadness within; a pain and a nightmare which could not be erased.
Many inhabitants of the land perceived this quality and privately
grieved for him.  Why could he who ruled this kingdom of peace
and love not be at peace and in love?
     After dinner in the villages or on hot lazy summer
afternoons or by the fire in winter, conversation often turned to
the mystery of the king's torment.  Had he been a great villain
or assassin in some other time or place?  Had he lost a loved son
or daughter?  But where was his lady?  In all the numberless
years of the king's rule, no one could ever remember him having a
woman by his side or showing the slightest interest in a woman
for the particular qualities of her sex.  Had his heart been
destroyed by the loss of his one true love?  A few of the crueler
minds in the kingdom suggested that perhaps he kept a woman
chained in his castle on whom all sorts of unspeakable acts were
committed.  The same few fools were also heard to say that
perhaps the king's lust exploded upon his men at arms or the
beasts in his stable.  Such voices were rare in the land,
however, for virtually all loved, if slightly feared, their good,
wise and self tormented king.
     Then one spring, the rains did not fall.  Such a thing had
not occurred within the memory af any living man or woman.  The
ground turned to powder and dust and the seed died for lack of
water.  Some attempts were made to irrigate the fields from
rivers and wells but the task was hopeless.  The rains had always
fallen and the people had never prepared themselves for, or even
dared imagine, their absence.  By early summer the heat was
unbearable, the rivers had dwindled to mere tiny creaks and many
wells had run dry.  Babes and young children began to die as
their mother's breasts ran dry.  Strang and unknown diseases
began to strike the weak, the old and the young.  Cries of
unquenchable grief assailed the stillness of the night as loved
ones died in a land that seemed to have lost its soul.
     During this time of death, the king was strangely absent.
After the first few days of unbearable heat and dryness had made
their appearance, he retreated to his castle and did not re-
emerge to continue his daily contacts with the people.  The
drawbridge over the castle moat was drawn up and what were now
stern and uncaring knights turned away all who inquired with
clipped, abrupt relies.  The kingdom's inhabitants resented the
king's absence, his seeming lack of caring during this time of
crisis for those whom he had so diligently looked after during
times of plenty.  Some began to wonder if the king had cursed his
subjects for the drought or some unknown and unspeakable offense
that he imagined they had committed.  But search in their hearts
as they may, they could discover no grievous wrong acted out upon
the king or themselves.  Besides, was not the king a mortal man?
Surely, the calamity upon them now could only come from the hands
of the gods.
     As summer waned, the heat and aridity became, incredibly,
even more extreme.  More of the young and old died and some of
the young, strong and beautiful went mad.  Summer did not merge
into fall and all hope of respite from the death heat dwindled.
     Then, one furnace ridden day, the dragon appeared.
     Many who were too tired or weak to raise their heads noticed
only a momemtary darkening of the mid-day sky.  Those who did
look up were both horrified and fascinated, awestruck and
immobilized with fear.  Now they were terrorized by a beast of
unimaginable proportions that filled half the sky and blotted out
the accursed orb of catastrophe itself.  The dragon was as long
as a wheat field and covered with blood red scales from the end
of its snout to the tip of its long pointed tail.  The beast's
hideous tongue was black, four enormous limbs ended in gleaming
white talons, two pairs of cobalt blue wings of a strangely
delicate structure rose form its back, and its absurd light grey
eyes were hypnotic and terrifying.
     The dragon circled the sun three times and came to rest in
an enormous shrivelled field that lay directly in front of the
king's castle.  The dragon settled itself slowly, adjusting its
wings and limbs several times as it found its most comfortable
resting position, belched several long tongues of green flame and
not a little smoke, and then quietly closed its eyes and went to
sleep.
     The populace huddled in their villages consumed by an
apotheosis of fear.  Few dared venture out. Many died for want of
water and food rather than expose themselves to the dragon.  The
great creature, however, seemed oblivious to all and neither ate
nor drank, neither moved nor stirred. and was never seen to open
its terrifying, light, grey eyes.  Only a faint plume of white
smoke that occasionally escaped from its tiny slitted nostrils,
signalled to all that this awesome, uncontrollable force was not
dead, but slumbered and waited for something - the gods only knew
what.
     The drought went on into the late fall with no slackening of
heat and dust, no slackening of death and madness.  Through it
all, the dragon still slept almost all the time never moving, but
now occasionally opened one light, grey eye to briefly survey the
castle.  An occasional villager would venture to the edge of the
field where the dragon slept, but most gave the great beast a
wide berth.
     The one suffocating, hot, still, breathless day that was
identical to the hundreds that had preceded it, the great door to
the castle swung open.  The drawbridge was lowered over the dried
out moat and the king rode forth on his favorite black stallion. 
He was alone and dressed in a black tunic crossed by a red sash
and at his waist hung a glistening, silver, battle sword.  The
king slowly cantered across the field and stopped his horse a few
yards from the great creature's nose.  He dismounted and knelt on
the ground.  Drawing the great sword from its scabbard, he placed
it upon the earth.  The king then bowed his head until it touched
the scorched grass and said in a loud, clear voice, "I am here
Cassandra.  Do with me what you will."
     The dragons right forelimb flashed out and raked the king's
body from head to toe.  An eruption of crimson flowed over the
earth.  The king died instantly without a sound.  The dragon
stirred, opened its eyes and stretched its legs and tail.  It
belched one long tongue of crimson flame and black smoke and
launched itself into the air.  One swift pass over the sun and it
was gone.
     Hours passed and the blazing sun coagulated the king's life
and he ceased to bleed.  One by one, the villagers and knights
came onto the field to stare.  They could scarcely believe that
their good, wise, compassionate and mysterious king was dead.  At
sundown, they buried him in the field in an unmarked grave.
     The next day, it rained.

brightly feathered arrow.  The blond youth stifled a gasp as the arrow imbedded
itself in the tree directly in front of his head.  Dropping into a crouch, the

arrow to pull itself out of the tree and fly back whence it came.
