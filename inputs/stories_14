     With that, Skulta left, and Richard was left alone.  Mortified,
Richard climbed out the lavatory window and ran home.
     That night, Richard grew restless. Searching for an escape from
his troubles, Richard took a walk through Plimpton park.  It was a hot
and toasty night, and Richard soon had to stop for a rest beside a
phone pole.  He sat down beside it, and was about to fall asleep, when
he heard a voice from above...
     "Hello what!" said the voice, as the dark figure descended from
the pole.  "I'm Bollix.  You can just call me Bollix, if you want.
What can I do you for?"
     "Well, mister, I'm nothing.  Nobody likes me anymore.
And...and... today in the bathroom, the Skulta peed on me and got me
smelly and sticky!"
     "Well it serves you right!  You're boring... umm.. no.  I didn't
say that.  What I meant to say is that you could avoid all this
alienation and crap.  What you need, my small friend, is a gimmick!"
     A look of interest arose on Richard's face, as Bollix revealed his
plan to give Richard a new image... a gimmick.
     "What you've got to do is get a gimmick.  Something unique.
Something special.  You know... a gimmick.  Like the professional
wrestlers.  But you know, they have lame gimmicks what.  You need
something impressive.  You can be... umm... let's see... you can be...
BAGEL MAN!  That's it!  It's your new image!  Your gimmick!  Trust me,
if you follow my instructions, you'll have the babes all over you and
the Skulta trembling at your feet!"
     Bollix proceeded to instruct Richard on the details of his new
image, and by the next morning, when he came to school, Richard was no
longer the young innocent boy he was the day before... he was no longer
Richard... he was... Bagel-Man!
     Part II coming soon!

	Below you will find the rules that my friends and I have come up 
with for Battletech.  These rules were meant to augment the existing 
rules, not replace them.  _The Battletech Compendium_ is the ruleook 
referenced throughout this text and is considered necessary for these rules 
to be used fully.
	One of the basic assumptions throughout this entire text is that 
the Clans do not exist.  Granted, some of the technology presented in here 
is Clan in nature or capability, but this system was started before the 
Clans were presented.  The history of the Battletech Universe has also been 
ignored completely.  This is evident with the huge variety of weapons and 
the fact that (for example) LB-X autocannons weigh more than standard 
autocannons.  For any system that is not specifically modifed or covered in 
these rules assume that the standard rules for "Inner Sphere" systems take 
precedence.
	The 2x engine rules were created some time ago, exact date 
forgotten.  These rules are of my design and should be considered 
copyrighted.  The Observer rules were created based upon ideas found in the 
Rec.Games.Mecha archives.  Credit is given at the end.
	The Internal Structure and Armor rules were developed recently and 
are pretty much an adjustment to existing rules plus added systems.  If 
anything appears to have come from FASA then it probably did.
	The Weapons list is a compilation of the existing weapons plus 
those developed by myself, my friends, and others.  The alternate 
ammunitions were an outgrowth of rules presented in the FASA product 
_Unbound_ and material found in the aforementioned archives.  
	The Infantry Rules were developed to make all types of infantry a 
viable selection.  These rules were also intened to make them a little more 
capable of playing a role on the battlefield.
	The Credit Section is where I give credit to those who inspired me 
to put something resembling their work into my compilation.  I tried to 
give credit where it is due, but if you feel slighted I apologize.  One 
source of inspiration and information tht is not credited there is FASA.  
They deserve the credit for anything that resembles material from the 
rulebook and the product _Unbound_.

	The 2xeng and 2xeng2xcockpit mech rules will require that you make 
new mech sheets for these monsters.  With a little bit of work, clear tape, 
and photocopies you can cut up, you can make the sheets no problem.  I'll 
give you what location has how many crits of each thing.
	2 ENGINE MECHS
	The two engine mech is simply a battlemech that has such a high 
speed that the weight or power requirements are so high that two engines 
are requird as opposed to one.  For a mech to have two engines, it must 
pass one of two requirements.  If it doesn't, then the mech will simply use 
one engine.  NOTE: The weight requirements below are based upon standard 
engine weights and are regardless of the possibility of the engines being 
ST or XL engines. 
	For the design of your mech, replace the rules for "Determine 
engine weight" with this list:
	1) Detremine the speed of the mech
	2) Determine the Engine rating
	3) Determine the Engine weight
	4) Check to see if steps 2 or 3 qualify the mech for 2x engine 
	   status.  If the mech does qualify, follow ths steps:
		A) If the last digit of the Engine rating is a 5, add 5 to 
		   the engine rating making it an even number.
		B) Divide the engine rating by 2 creating the engine 
		   ratings of the 2 smaller engines to be used.
		C) Use the smaller engine ratings to determine the engine 
		   weights of the two smaller engines.  
		D) Modify the weights of the engines appropriately if you 
		   are going to use ST or XL engines.
		E) Add the weights of the engines together to determine the 
		   final weight of th engines. 
	(Note: Gyro weight is based upon the engine rating from line 4A.)
		  
REQUIREMENTS:
If the mech is 55-100 tons, then the requirements are:
	1) The required engine rating is above 400
			or
	2) The weight of the engine required is 75% or greater than the 
	   weight of the mech.
If the mech is 5-50 tons, then the requirements are:
	1) The required engine rating is above 400
			or
	2) The weight of the engine required is 50% or greater than the
	   weight of the mech.
	Now that the rules for what mechs are allowed to have 2 engines 
have been established, next are the special rules pertaining to them.
	1) Since the mech has 2 fusion engines, it also has 20 heat sinks.
		A) They can be made double heat sinks.
		B) The number of HS that can be put on to an engine w/out 
		   being represented on the critical hit table is based 
		   upon the engine rating of each engine, not the combined 
		   engine ratings. 
		C) If the engine heat sinks are double HS, then divide the 
		   number of heat sinks that can be put on an engine by the 
		   number of crits each double heat sink takes up. (This 
		   rule is put in so that double heat sinks are not common 
		   and do not unbalance the game since heat is the 
		   restraining factor in this game.  This rule is also 
		   under the assumption that the rules concerning mixing 
		   standard and double heat sinks are changed.  If you want 
		   to, you can mount double and standard HS on a mech.  All 
		   of the heat sinks from the engines must be the same 
		   type.  All 20 must be either double or standard, not 
		   half&half.  If you keep the original rule saying ALL 
		   heat sinks must be the same type, then you may also 
		   consider possibly ignore this subrule completely.
	2) A damage track is kept for each engine.  It is possible for a 2x 
	   engine mech to recieve 4 engine hits, 2 per engine.  When one of 
	   the two engines receives 3 hits, it is destroyed and the move 
	   rate of the mech is halved, rounding down.  The destroyed engine 
	   also stops producing heat due to damage or moving.  A 2x engine 
	   mech is considered destroyed when both engines are destroyed, 
	   i.e.: When each engine has received 3 engine hits.  Any HS 
	   mounted on the engine and not represented on the crit. hit table 
	   for the mech are also destroyed. 
	3) When the internal structure for a side torso has been completely 
	   destroyed, that sides engine is also counted as destroyed with the 
	   appropriate effects for losing one engine as outlined in rule 2.
	4) The Critical Hit table for a 2x engined mech is different from 
	   that you would find on a standard one.
		A) Change the center torso by changing all engine slots 
		   (11,12,13,22,23,24) into empty slots that can mount
		   equipment.
		B) Change both of the side torsos to this slot 
		   configuration:
			Standard	ST Engines	XL Engines
			1. Engine	1. Engine	1. Engine
			2. Engine	2. Engine	2. Engine
			3. Engine	3. Engine	3. Engine
			4. ______	4. ______	4. Engine
			5. ______	5. ______	5. Engine
			6. ______	6. ______	6. Engine
			1. ______	1. Engine	1. Engine
			2. Engine	2. Engine	2. Engine
			3. Engine	3. Engine	3. Engine
			4. Engine	4. Engine	4. Engine
			5. ______	5. Engine	5. Engine
			6. ______	6. Engine	6. Engine
	(As you can see, you have a high to 100% chance of getting an 
	 engine hit with the more advanced engines.)
	5) If the engines are going to use ST or XL technology, both must 
	   be of the same type.
	6) The heat produced from movement is doubled with 2x engine mechs. 
	   Walking heat is 2 while running produces 4 heat.
        7) As before, regardless of technology level of the engine, each 
	   engine requires only 3 engine hits to be destroyed.
	DESIGN NOTES ON 2X ENGINE MECHS:  These rules were written long 
before the clans came into the picture.  They were even written before the 
rules for XL engines were published.  From the time we came out with the 
rules for 2x engine mechs, we have experimented with rules for 2x engine 
tanks (we never goofed with aerospace fighters, but that would be another 
logical growth of the rules.)  The rules we developed never did seem 
balanced and seemed to require a major rewrite of the tank rules, which we 
did for some areas.  If you desire to have 2x engine tanks, you may want to 
take a long hard look at them.  Realize that the limiting factors for 2x 
engine mechs are: loss of internal space, loss of armor protection for the 
engines due to sitting in the side torsos, ease of getting engine hits due to 
doubled number of engine crits, and increased heat for movement.  All of these 
limiting factors are not available for tanks based on the available rules.  
There are no damage locations where tank engines are.  There are no 
internal crit slots for tanks.  Tanks don't have to worry about movement 
heat.  As you can see, tanks were made overly simple so that they were easy 
to play and integrate.  Due to these simplifications, you can't easily 
integrate 2x engine rules for them.  On further investigation, you'll see 
that the same problems exist for aerospace fighters, conventional fighters, 
and the other vehicles.  If you are going to put rules for 2x engines in 
for other vehicles, you will have to rebuild a lot of the game.
	The Clans would probably never have 2x engine mechs.  Their mechs 
tend to point to a huge standardization policy throughout the clans and 
would be very slow to change to 2x engines upon discovering 2x engine 
mechs.  Even with those points of logic out of the way, it should be 
apparent enough that the clans are nasty enough as they are and need no 
further modification.  You will find that 2x engine mechs come only half 
way to meeting the clans on even grounds.  *I* wouldn't want a 100 ton clan 
mech with 2x engines stomping on my face and ripping my lipps off!  
	SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY  (ST)  ENGINES
	ST engines were developed primarily to incorporate the weight 
saving capabilities of XL engines without the huge space requirements.  ST 
engines are best described as being halway between standard and XL engines. 
ST engines are best used on one engine mechs that need extra tonnage for 
ballistic weapons and extra space for the weapons themselves.  For 2x 
engine mechs, internal space becomes critically short when both engines are 
made XL, making the use of ST engines predominant.  
	1) ST engines weigh .75 the weight of a standard engine, this in 
	   comparison to XL engines that weigh .5 the weight of a standard
	   engine.
	2) ST engines require 3 extra crit slots on a critical hit table.  
	   These crit slots have already been described for 2x engine 
	   mechs.  For one engine mechs, ST engines require one extra slot 
	   in each of the 3 torsos.
	3) 3 engine hits are required to destroy an ST engine, regardless 
	   if they are in the side or center torsos. 
	4) For figuring the costs of an ST engine, as per p. 128 of _The 
	   Battletech Compendium_, use the formula of:
		(10,000 x rating x tonnage) / 75
	NOTES ON ST ENGINES:  As you can see, ST engines are halfway XL 
engines.  That's what they are intended to be.  When I first came up with 
ST engines, I had trouble convincing my friends the need of ST engines.  
They are truly put in for 2x engine mechs, I have never seen their use on 
one engine mechs.  Use them as you please.
	The Clans would probably never use ST engines.  They would more 
then likely use XL engines exclusively.
	Historically, you could say that ST engines are a stepping stone to 
XL engines, with their use relegated primarily to 2x engine mechs.  You 
could also say that Peripheral houses and governments developed them as 
their best effort to reach XL technology.
	2X COCKPIT and 2X ENGINE 2X COCKPIT MECHS
	2x cockpit mechs are a natural outgrowth of mech designs that had 2 
seats in a mech cockpit where one seat was for the mech pilot and the 
other seat was for a commander/observer/nobody useful.  There are 3 types 
of 2x cockpit mechs: one engine 2x cockpit, 2x engine 2x cockpit Alpha, and 
2x engine 2x cockpit Beta.  After the descriptions of the three type of 2x 
cockpit mechs rules will be given for their use.
NOTE:  When examples of the internal structure are shown, there will be two 
empty critical slots with astricks.  These are the slots for "extra" 
sensors to be placed in.  They will be explained later in the rules.
	2X COCKPIT MECHS:
	These designs are achieved through the removal of the cockpit from 
the head and replacing it with a cockpit in each side torso.
	1) The critical hit table is modified by replacing the head with 
	   six empty crit slots.  This effectively turns the head from a 
 	   cockpit center into a weapons platform.  This platform can have a 
 	   turret like a ground vehicle where the turret mechanism weighs 
	   ten percent of the weapons mounted (round up to the nearest half 
	   ton).  When the armor has been breached and internals have been 
	   scored, roll for turret lock where the turret locks on a roll of 
	   1-3.  If the turret locks, it locks facing the hexside that it 
	   was firing into that turn.
	2) The side torsos are modified as such:
		LEFT SIDE TORSO			RIGHT SIDE TORSO
		1) Life Support			1) Life Support
		2) Sensors			2) Sensors
	1	3) Cockpit		1	3) Cockpit
		4) _______			4) _______
		5) _______*			5) _______*
		6) Life Support			6) Life Support
		1) _______			1) _______
		2) _______			2) _______
	2	3) _______		2	3) _______
		4) _______			4) _______
		5) _______			5) _______
		6) _______			6) _______
	3) The pilot can be in one side or the other as long as which side 
	   has the pilot and which side has the gunner is marked on the 
	   sheet before the game begins. 
	2X ENGINE 2X COCKPIT MECHS ALPHA
	These types of mechs are achieved through the addition of a cockpit 
to the center torso.  Traditionally the gunner would be positioned in the 
torso and the pilot would be in the head.  This arrangement can be swapped 
around with little problem, but it would seem more logical to have the 
pilot in the head.
	1) The head cannot be mounted on a turret.
	2) The head and Center torso critical hit tables would look like 
this:
		Center torso		Head
		1) _______		1) Life Support
		2) _______		2) _______*
	1	3) _______		3) Cockpit
		4) Gyro			4) _______
		5) Gyro			5) _______*
		6) Gyro			6) Life Support
		1) Life Support
		2) Sensors
	2	3) Cockpit
		4) Gyro
		5) Sensors
		6) Life Support
	3) To put the gunner in the head, move the sensors from the center 
torso and put them in the #2 and #5 slots in the head.
	2X ENGINE 2X COCKPIT MECHS BETA
	These types of mechs are achieved through putting both of the 
cockpits in the center torso.  The advantage of this arrangement is that the 
head can act as a weapons platform like the rules above state.  The primary 
disadvantage is that whenever the center torso is hit on a 2, both pilots 
take damage and roll for consciousness.
	1) The head can act as a turreted weapons platform as discussed 
above in the rules for 2x cockpit mechs.
	2) The center torso is modified as such:
		CENTER TORSO
		1) Life Support
		2) Gyro
	1	3) Cockpit
		4) Gyro
		5) Gyro
		6) Life Support
		1) Life Support
		2) Sensors
	2	3) Cockpit
		4) Gyro
		5) Sensors
		6) Life Support
	3) The pilot is in the upper cockpit while the gunner is in the 
lower cockpit. Notice also that there are no provisions for there to be 
backup sensors on this type of mech.
	GENERAL RULES COVERING 2X COCKPIT MECHS
	1) There are 2 cockpits on 2x cockpit mechs.  One is for a pilot 
where the other one is for a gunner.  These two pilots work together to 
pilot and fight the mech.  The cumulative effect of these two working 
together and being able to concentrate on their jobs is that the piloting and 
gunnery skills are better.  To reflect these advantages, a mech with two 
cockpits has a -1 bonus on its to hit and piloting target numbers.
	2) The pilot controls the piloting functions of the mech, but he 
can also do weapons firing.  If the gunner should be killed, the pilot can 
take over weapons fire.  The turn after the gunner is killed, the mech can 
not fire weapons but can still move.  This represents the pilot realizing the 
loss of the gunner and switching over gunnery systems to his control.  
After this turn of lost weapons fire, the pilot operates the mech without 
the piloting skill bonus and has a +1 penalty to weapons fire.
	3) The gunner controls the firing functions of the mech, but he can 
also pilot the mech.  If the pilot should be killed, the gunner can take 
over moving the mech.  The turn after the pilot is killed, the mech can not 
move but may continue to fire weapons.  This represents the gunner 
realizing the loss of the pilot and switching over movement systems to his 
control.  After this turn of lost movement, the gunner operates the mech 
without the gunnery bonus and has a +1 penalty to piloting skill.
	4) The bonuses and penalties mentioned above are treated just like 
any of the bonuses and penalties found in the rules and can be made 
cumulative with any other modifiers.  If the players are using the optional 
rules for DNI and VRPP piloting enhancements, they can also be used with 2x 
cockpit mechs.  (The two pilots had better know each other *VERY* well to 
be allowed to use DNI.)
	5) If both the pilot and the gunner are killed, then the mech is 
considered destroyed.     
	6) The Sensors that were deleted from one of the cockpits can be 
left in to serve as backup sensors.  Either one or both of the deleted 
sensors can be left in.  As long as there are two undestroyed Sensors 
critical hit locations remaining on the mech, there is no effect from 
Sensors hits.
	7) When a 2 is rolled onto a torso hit location that has a cockpit 
in it will also damage the pilot/gunner like a head hit. 
	8) When a 2x cockpit mech falls, the pilot must roll two piloting 
skill rolls to determine if both he and the gunner take damage.  Roll each 
one seperately.
	9) When ammunition explodes, each pilot takes one point of damage 
as oppossed to both taking two points.  If one of the pilots is dead, then 
the other takes 2 points of damage.
	10) Life support hits are kept for each cockpit and are seperate 
from each other.  It is possible for one pilot to take hits from excess 
heat and the other to be perfectly fine.
	11) Conciousness rolls for each pilot are done seperately and are 
independant of each other.  It is possible for one pilot to be unconcious 
while the other is not.  If this should happen, treat the unconcious pilot 
to be "temporarely" dead.  Refer to rules 2 & 3 for switchover procedure.  
When the unconcious pilot regains conciousness, he may resume his functions 
at the beginning of the next turn. 
	Design notes on 2x cockpit mechs:  2x cockpit mechs are just about 
the epitome of Battlemech technology when you combine 2x engine 2x cockpit 
rules with ST/XL engine rules.  Throw in any other sundry advanced 
technologies you wish and you will have true war machines.
	These rules were developed well before the Clans came out.  Based 
on the reading I've done, I don't think the clans would go for this type of 
mechs.  Their honor code would seem to dictate that they fight "without 
someone else's help."  Anyway, would you want the Clans to be any more 
powerful?
	C O C K P I T   S E C O N D   S E A T S / O B S E R V E R S 
	Normally the cockpit of a mech has a second seat for a passenger 
but that seat has no special function.  These rules are designed to add 
special seatings for specialty observers.  Note that the people in these 
seats *CAN NOT* control the mech that they are in in any special manner or 
way.  (Exception:  Mech Gunners)  They are only observers.
	If the critical hit location that the second chair takes up is 
destroyed then the passenger is killed and cannot perform their function.  
If the pilot's critical hit location is destroyed then the mech is 
considered destroyed for one cockpit mechs.  2x cockpit mechs are different 
in that the cockpit up in the head (normally the pilot's cockpit) is the 
only cockpit that can have a second chair.  Destruction of the head still 
results in the Observers death as well as the pilot/gunner, but the 2x 
cockpit mech still functions as per the 2x cockpit rules.  (Exception:  
Mech Gunners:  The mech is not considered destroyed if the head is still 
intact and the pilot is unconcious/dead then the gunner can still fire the 
mech's weapons.  Mech gunners can not be used in 2x cockpit mechs.)
	Artillery Spotter:  The Artillery Spotter is a trained professional 
in the coordination of off-board artillery fire.  Their seat has range 
finding and communication equipment built in to assist them.
	ADVANTAGES:  The AS mech can act as an oberver for off board 
artillery fire.  Any off board artillery fire using this mech as the 
observer gets a -2 to hit bonus for Observing unit Gunnery Skill as per 
p.49 of _The Battletech Compendium_.
	WEIGHT:  The Artillery Spotter seat weighs 1.5 tons and takes 
up 1 critical location in the head.
	Company Commander:  The company commander can be in a command mech 
that has a trusted pilot piloting his mech while he pays attention to the 
battle.  His attention to the battle plus his training gives his company a 
special advantage over those that do not have a dedicated command mech.
	ADVANTAGES:  The Command Mech and the 11 other mechs designated as 
being in the comapany get a special and seperate Initiative Roll.  They 
roll 2D6 for their Initiative instead of the regular 1D6.
	DISADVANTAGES/REQUIREMENTS:  For the Company Commander to be able 
to do his/her job the command mech must be equipped with 2 C^3 Masters and 
the rest of the company must be set up with the C^3 system as per the rules 
in _The Battletech Compendium_ p.118.  This communication and coordination 
still continues even if LOS between company mates is blocked or there is a 
Guardian operating in the LOS, even if the C^3 does not work.
	WEIGHT:  The Commander's seat weighs 1 ton and takes up 1 critical 
spot in the head.
	Forward Observer:  The Forward Observer is a person trained in the 
coordination and directin of all indirect fire.  S/he can assist in the firing 
of normal artillery fire and indirect missile fire.
	ADVANTAGES:  The FO mech can act as an observer for a unit firing 
LRM or BRM missiles indirectly.  For this fire there is no +1 automatic 
penalty to the to hit and the FO mech can make attacks as normal.  The FO 
mech can also act as a spotter for off board artillery fire, giving a -1 to 
hit bonus for Observing unit Gunnery Skill as per p.49 of _The Battletech 
Compendium_.
	WEIGHT:  The Forward Observer seat weighs 1 tons and 1 critical 
spot in the head.
	Mech Gunner:  The Mech Gunner is a Mechwarrior in a specially 
designed chair that allows the gunner to fire the mech's weapons while the 
normal pilot concentrates on piloting the mech.  While this system has the 
same advantages as 2 cockpits, it still has the inherent disadvantage that 
destroying the head will knock out the mech.
	ADVANTAGES:  The mech with a mech gunner can fire weapons and pilot 
better.  Any Piloting Skill rolls and weapons fire is done at a -1 bonus, 
cumulative with other bonuses and penalties.
	DISADVANTAGES:  The mech gunner in this system cannot be combined 
with the 2 cockpit system, it is either/or.  If the gunner gets knocked out 
via unconciousness or critical hit then the mech cannot fire weapons.  If 
the pilot is knocked out in a similar manner then the mech cannot move.  If 
the head is destroyed then the mech is counted as destroyed.  Otherwise 
refer to rules 8, 9, and the first part of 11 in the 2 cockpit rules for 
assitional information.  Mech Gunner chairs can not be installed on 2x 
cockpit mechs.
	WEIGHT:  The Mech Gunner seat weighs 2 tons and takes up 1 critical 
hit location in the head.

	There are several different types of internal structures, armors,

	Endo Steel:  This is the same as presented in the books with the 
exception of changing the number of critical hit locations that are taken 
up.  This is done to make its use more viable.
	TONS:  Half Standard
	Slots:  10
	Nitivir Composite:  This extra strong internal structure is made 
from a laticed composite of Nickel, Titanium, Vanadium, Iridium, and other 
standard metals.  This combonation is heavier and bulkier than standard 
internal structure but is 25% more resilient to damage and allows the mech 
to mount heavier armor.
	The mech with Nitivir Composite multiplies the amount of internal 
points for each of the internal structure areas by 1.25, round .5 up.  This 
new, higher number is the amount of internal structure each area has and is 
used as the base for the max number of armor points that the area can mount.  
If the number of internal structure or armor points in a location exceeds the 
number of circles that the mech sheet has simply write the excess points next 
to the appropriate location.
	TONS:  Standard
	Slots:  10
	Standard Internal Structure:  The standard internal structure is 
not changed at all from the rules.  It is though used as the basis of 
comparison for the other internal structures.
	---	---	---	---	---	---	---	---
	The below armor types are "base" armors and are not compatible with 
each other.  See the defensive systems below to see which are compatible 
with what.
	Ferro-Fibrous Armor:  This armor is like that presented in the 
rules with changes to make its use more viable.  The Armor Value is 
multiplied by 1.2 instead of 1.12.  (Where did they get 1.12?)
	TONS:  Standard
	Slots:  10
	Ceramo-Steel Armor:  This armor uses the natural heat resistive 
properties of ceramic materials and meshes them within layers of standard 
armor.  Ceramo-Steel armor comes in 2 ratings: Level 1 and Level 2. 
	Level 1 Ceramo-Steel comes with a armor rating multiplier of 1.1 
similar to Ferro-Fibrous and makes the mech invulnerable to energy weapons 
target heat (From lasers, PPCs, etc).  Incindiery Target Heat from Infernos, 
Flamers, and the like still affect the mech normally. 
	Level 2 Ceramo-Steel Armor gets no armor multiplier but makes the 
mech invulnerable to *any* target heat.
	TONS: Standard (for both levels)
	Slots:  10 (for both levels)
	Reflective Armor:  This is an armor where the armor plates have been 
covered in layers of polished metallic flakes.  The effect is to reduce the 
effectiveness of lasers hitting the target.  The disadvantage is that the 
overall armor resiliancy is reduced.
	Reflective Armor reduces the effectiveness of incoming laser fire.  
All laser fire that hits the mounting vehicle has 1 point of damage 
subtracted from it.  EXAMPLE:  A large laser and 2 medium lasers are fired 
at a tank with reflective armor.  The net damage is: 15 (8-1 + 5-1 + 5-1).
	Reflective armor gives less protection than standard armor and  
is expressed by multiplying the number of armor points available by .9.
	Standard Armor:  This ablative armor is not changed from the game, 
yet is used as the basis of comparison for other armors.
	---	---	---	---	---	---	---	---
	Below are defensive systems that can be designed into a mech in 
addition to other armors/defensive systems.  Refer to the description of 
each one to determine what can armors/systems can be used on the same 
mech/vehicle.
	Blue Shield Project:  This system is a concentrated particle field 
dampener which dissipates incoming PPC fire.
	Blue Shield way 3 tons and takes up one critical hit space in each 
of the mech/vehicle's hit locations.  This system halves the damage of any 
LPPC, PPC, HPPC, or variants.  A critical hit to a Blue Shield slot destroys 
the entire shield.
	Every time that Blue Shield is activated by PPC or HPPC hit roll 
2D6.  On a roll of 2 when hit by a PPC or on a roll of 2 or 3 when hit by 
HPPC the system overloads, destroying all of the shield critical locations 
and inflicting 5 points of internal damage to all of the hit locations 
except for the head which takes one point of internal damage.
	Blue Shield is compatible with all of the armors and can be use 
with the other defensive systems.
	Chameleon System:  This is a system that evaluates the surrounding 
terrain with electronic sensors and changes the color scheme of the armor 
on the mech/vehicle.  It works best when the mounting vehicle is not moving 
and in some type of obscuring terrain.
	The Chameleon System weighs 3 tons and takes up one critical hit 
space in each hit location.  This system adds a +1 to hit penalty to any 
weapons fire against the mounting vehicle when the mounting vehicle is 
standing still, walks/cruises or jumps.  It has no effect when the mounting 
vehicle runs/flanks.  When the mounting vehicle is stationary for the turn 
in a hex that provides terrain modifiers to hit (Woods, smoke, etc.) the 
terrain to hit penalties against the mounting vehicle are used as the 
effects of the Chameleon System.  EXAMPLE: Fred walks his mech that has 
the Chameleon System and ends it in a heavy woods hex.  Since he walked it 
any fire against his mech has a +1 to hit penalty in addition to any other 
modifiers.  The next turn Fred does not move his mech, remaining in the 
heavy woods hex.  The Chameleon System gives any fire against the mech a +4 
to hit penalty (+2 for heavy woods hex that the Chameleon System emulates) 
in addition to the +2 for the heavy woods his mech is in and any other 
modifiers.
	The Chameleon System is not very good at keeping the color 
coordination if the mounting vehicle is running/flanking or jumping.  This 
difficulty can overload the system with disasterous results.  At the end of 
any turn that the mounting vehicle runs/flanks or jumps it must roll 2D6.  
On a roll of 2, 3, or 4 the system has overloaded and explodes.  This destroys 
all of the system's critical locations and inflicts 5 points of internal 
damage to all of the hit locations except for the head which takes one point 
of internal damage.
	The Chameleon System can be used with all armors except Reflective 
Armor and defensive systems except for Reactive Armor.
	Reactive Armor:  This is bolted on armor that protects the mech 
from slow incoming projectiles by using a shaped charge to blow them away.  
It can be combined with any of the other types of armor.  The covering of 
Reactive Armor requires internal support brackets which take up space.
	Reactive Armor requires 1 critical hit space in each of the mech's/ 
vehicle's locations and weighs equal to the mech's/vehicle's tonnage/20.  Any 
missile and certain other weapon attacks made against the target with reactive 
armor do half damage, round fractions up.  The armor location hit must have 
armor points left for this to work or there will be no effect.  Any critical 
hits to the Reactive Armor slots count as no effect.  VTOLs may not have 
reactive armor.  Reactive Armor has no effect upon TSM or Inferno.
	Every time that the mech is hit by missile fire and Reactive Armor 
is used roll 2D6.  On a roll of a 2 the armor has blown back the missile at 
a bad angle.  Apply the half damage to the location hit and then roll for 
another hit location.  This second hit location takes an equal amount of 
damage as the first.
	Reactive Armor is compatible with all armor and defensive systems 
except for Chameleon System.  Reactive Armor will not explode when set 
afire.

	1) The .5 critical means that 2 of these weapons can be fitted into 
one location.  If this location gets hit, both weapons are lost.  The two 
weapons can be considered "banked" as per the rules below.  Any weapn that 
takes up x.5 critical hit locations can fit another .5 critical hit 
location item with one of its lines.  Example: An LBX-15 takes up 8.5 
critical hit locations.  On one of the lines a small laser can share the 
same line as one of the 9 LBX-15 lines.  Another example would be where a 
CRM/3 has 1.5 tons of ammo assigned to it.  The first line would be 
"CRM/3," the second would read "CRM/3 & 1/2 ton ammo," and the last line 
would read "1 ton CRM/3 ammo." 	
	2) The .5 Target Heat means that for every 2 medium lasers that 
hit, the target receives 1 point of heat.  Refer to the Target Heat rules 
found below.
	3) The large laser and variants had their weights reduced to make 
them more competitive with other weapons.  It seemed that the large laser 
was not worth the weight of the weapon, therefore the weight is reduced on 
this weapons list.
	4) These two weapons seemed like natural outgrowthes of the 
standard PPC.  The pulse PPC's also seemed like they should belong somehow. 
Their only special rule is that there is a -1 to hit for them as opposed to 
the -2 for the pulse lasers.
	5) The Electrical Discharge Cannon is an energy weapon designed 
around the principle of discharging huge amounts of electrical energy into 
the target.  For the EDC to fire, a discharge coil is needed.  As this coil 
burns out everytime the weapon fires, the weapon is designed to have a new 
coil placed in the receptacle and the burned out one cycled out in a way 
similar to an autocannon reload system.  Thus in the listing for the weapon 
under ammunition the number gives how many coils.
		A)  The "ammunition" for the EDC is not truly ammo.  When 
	it is hit it does not explode.
		B)  The EDC will cause collateral damage to units in water 
	hexes.  If the EDC hits a target in or above (like hovercraft or 
	LAM at 1 elevation) water the EDC does full damage to all targets 
	in that hex.  Any units in or above water 1 hex away will receive 
	full damage minus 5 points.  Any units in or above water 2 hexes 
	away will receive full damage minus 10 points of damage.  Any unit 
	3 or more hexes away is safe from collateral damage.
	6)  The weights of the lighter autocannons were lowered because 
they were perceived to be to heavy for them to be worth taking.  The 
benefits of low heat and high range were not enough to counter the drawbacks
of very high weight and possibility of ammo explosions.  It got to the point 
that all A/C 2 through A/C 10 were replaced with different weapons due to 
their attractiveness.  Therefore the weights of some of the A/C were 
reduced.
	7) The weights of the LBX autocannons were made higher than the 
standard models to compensate for the fact that they were better than 
standard autocannons.  Granted, these changes to the various autocannons 
are not historical, but then again, who plays historically?
	8) The Flamer and the Flame Thrower are modified to make them more 
worth their weight.  In addition to doing their damage, these weapons incur 
"incindiery" target heat upon their target.  The target heat from these 
weapons will remain on the target for 3 turns.  Any additional target 
heat beyond 10 points carries over for an additional 3 turns.  Refer to the 
target heat rules below.
	9) The coolant cannon is "weapon" that does no damage and is 
designed to cool down mech in one of two methods.  The first is to take any 
flame/inferno heat that is sticking to the target and eliminate it.  Any 
flame/inferno heat fired upon the target after it has been cooled will act 
normally.  This first method of cooling will take precedence over the 
second method.  (This first method of "attack" is similar to blowing out a 
candle or using a fire extinguisher to put out a fire.)
		The second method of "attack" for a coolant cannon is to 
eliminate 10 points of heat generated that turn by the target.  This can be 
done only if the target has no flame/inferno target heat generating at the 
time.  If the target has less than 10 points of flame/inferno heat 
generateing at the time, for example 6 points, the coolant cannon would 
eliminate the 6 points of fame/inferno heat and reduce the heat generated 
by the target by 4.  In general terms, the coolant cannon does -10 points 
of target heat.  It will eliminate up to 10 points of flame/inferno heat.  
Any remaining coolant cannon "damage" will reduce that turns heat output 
for the target by the remaining amount.
		Coolant cannons can only be mounted on ground vehicles 
since the volume of the coolant is too large to mount on a battlemech.  If 
rules are made such that a coolant cannon were to take up crits, the number 
is listed in parentheses.
	10) Bombardment Range Missiles (BRM)  BRM's are an extreme range 
weapon designed to saturate an area with warheads.  It is a rather erratic 
weapon in its performance, but this is compensated for by its long range.
		A) BRM's do not roll on the missile hit chart to determine 
	the number of missiles that hit.  Instead, a number of D6 are rolled to 
	determine the number that hit.  When firing at Extreme Range a 
	number of D6-1 are rolled and the number of D3 when firing at 
	Maximum range.
		B) The damage that a BRM does is distributed as an LRM would 
	would.  Every 5 points of damage is rolled for.
		C) If Artemis is tied in to a BRM, an extra D6 is rolled to 
	determine the number of missiles that hit.  If the number of missiles 
	that would hit is greater than the rating of the launcher, then simply
	all of the missiles hit.     
		D) BRM's may indirect fire just as LRM's can.
	11) Tactical Support Missiles (TSM)  TSM's are an area effect, mech 
mounted, reloadable weapon system based loosely on the LRM.  It utilizes an 
airburst schrapnel charge to spread its damage over an area.
		A) TSM's do 5 points of damage to any units in the target hex 
	and 2 points of damage to any units one hex away from the target 
	hex.  (The 6 surrounding hexes)
		B) Like artillery, TSM's attack hexes rather than units.  
	The to hit roll is modified only by intervening terrain and the 
	attacking unit's movement and condition, never by the movement or 
	condition of units in the hex.
		C) To determine the number of missiles that hit, roll on 
	the Missile Hit Chart under the appropriate number.  (Obviously the 
	TSM/1 is a hit or miss deal.)
		D) Roll for scatter for any TSM's that did not hit their 
	intended target hex.  Use the Artillery scatter method.  Roll each 
	missile seperately.
		E) The firing of TSM's cannot be modified or helped by the 
	following systems: Artemis, AAR, GAR, NARC, TAG, or anything 
	else that would improve the accuracy or damage of the missile.  
	(This restriction does not apply to 2x cockpit mechs, C^3, or 
	pilot/gunners that have an improved gunnery skill.) This reflects the 
	fact that the TSM is a ballistic missile that air bursts over the 
	target and cannot really be guided to the explosion point.  Another 
	reason is because these things are nasty enough as they are! 
		F)  When TSM ammunition explodes due to heat or critical 
	hit each missile explodes for 7 points of damage.
	12) MRM's (Medium Range Missiles)  Medium Range Missiles were 
developed as support weapons that would have a longer range than SRM's but 
shorter range than LRM's.	
		A) To resolve a missile hit from an MRM, conduct it in a 
	manner similar to an LRM except that MRM hit in groups of 3 as 
	opposed to in groups of 5 as with LRM.
		B) MRM can not be fired in indirect fire mode.  They are, 
	except as noted previouslly, functionally similar to LRM.
	13) CRM (Close Range Missiles) are an functionally similar to SRM's 
except that they do 3 points of damage per missile that hits.
	14) Inferno weapons.  The only changes from the Inferno rules as 
listed on p.60 of _The Battletech Compendium_ are listed below. 
		A) The max target heat that Infernos (of any kind) can deliver 
	is 10 instead of 6.
		B) Inferno/1 is based upon the TSM/1.  Use notes 11B, 11D, and 
	11E for additional information.  The Inferno/1 delivers 5 target 
	heat to anything in the target hex and 2 target heat to anything in 
	the 6 immediately surrounding hexes.
		C) While the Geneva Conventions and the rules may prohibit 
	the use of incindiery weapons against infantry, we warmongers will 
	not.  The number of men killed by an inferno attack is equal to the 
	target heat inflicted.  
	15) TAG Laser.  The TAG laser appeared to be too limited in scope 
for your average warmonger.  To make the TAG laser more useful for its 
weight it was decided to make it helpful for normal missile attacks in 
addition to your average Arrow IV attack.  In addition to its normal 
functions, the TAG laser can be used by a mech about to make a missile 
attack against a target.  Fire the TAG laser first.  If it hits then any
