                                 Vacuum cleaners, brooms, running water,
                                The clanking of utensils, cups, & plates,
                                  Every now and then the toaster pops.
                                   This busy scurrying continues until

Waiuku:
At Norcon `84 I had fun. I had plenty of money and plenty of time and I
spent the 1984 NZ National SF Con having a Real Good Time. Somehow,
very early one morning late in the con, I found myself walking the streets of
sleeping Auckland with a blonde woman of compact build and round, impish
face. I think that we had happened to leave a late room-party at the same
time for a breath of air, and had started talking. I cannot now remember
anything much of what we said, except that it was all pleasant and
entertaining and that conversation was all that passed between us. Her name
was Maree, and she had come to the con from a place called Waiuku. We
talked about our respective hometowns, and somewhere along the way she
mentioned that I must come and see Waiuku some time. Naturally I said
that I would do just that -- but I must admit that I didn't expect to go
through with this promise. The con ended and I went back to Wellington
and then I quit my job and started the wandering which has filled so much
of `History'. I thought of Maree every now & then, but there didn't seem
much hope of getting around to visiting. Waiuku is quite isolated on one of
the peninsulas that bound Manukau Harbour, and I saw no easy way to get
there.
    But then I bought the bike, and started cycle-touring. And one day I
looked at the map and realised that I was now fit enough so that the
distance from Te Aroha to Waiuku by road -- some 127 kilometres --
represented no more than a single hard day's ride to me. So I wrote Maree
a letter and told her what I planned and when I planned to do it, and she
wrote back and gave me exact directions on finding her place, and one day
I loaded up the bike and set out to cycle to visit Maree.
    I'll gloss over the standard details. What started out as a long but not-too-
hard-looking jaunt became a nightmare. I had left Te Aroha at 8am, but with
rest stops and hills that demanded I stop and walk, night fell about the time
I was passing through Waiuku. (If I could remember exactly when this
happened I could place this trip more precisely in time, but I can't.) Maree
lived about 10 kilometres out on the far side, and I perforce pushed on into
the darkness with the aid of a torch. (I had no lights on the bike, since I
hadn't envisaged doing any night riding.) Fortunately there was little traffic.
But it was with some relief that I finally picked out -- having gone past it
once and having a moment of panic when I suspected I was lost (suspected?
I was certain!) -- the box-thorn hedge that marked the turnoff to the farm
where Maree lived with her mother (I think it was her mother -- an older
relative, anyway. Sorry, another memory glitch). My state of mind -- and
exhaustion -- can be gauged by the fact that try as I might, I cannot bring a
single memory into focus to help me with retelling my arrival. As I wheeled
my bike around the back of the house, did a door open and spill warm
yellow light onto the grass? Or did I prop the bike against something and
knock? I have half-images of doing both these things, and they are mutually
exclusive.
    About other events I can be more circumstantial. Maree had just returned
from an overseas trip (another reason it had taken me so long to get around
to dropping in) during which she toured parts of north America and Europe.
At a moment when conversation was flagging a bit, her mother suggested
that she should get out her photo albums and tell me about her trip. `Ah!'
I said, `this is one of the reasons why I came here!' And so Maree brought
out several huge volumes packed with photos.
    Looking at photos of someone else's trip is the sort of thing that I
normally do as much as a duty as because I am particularly keen to see one
more shot of my friend standing self-consciously in some spot that I would
prefer to have been standing in myself. When Maree shows you her photos,
however, the experience is something as far above that as STAR WARS is
above a still shot of a tomato. Normally somewhat placid, suddenly she lights
up. Although you can participate in a conversation with her if you like, you
can equally well make nothing save the standard encouraging sounds and let
her enthusiasm carry you away for an hour or two. This is not a trip report,
a travelogue, or a recounting of events; this is a story -- a coherent narrative
illustrated by the photos, having beginning, middle, and end, dotted with plot
twists and surprise guests and odd characters. It was easy for me to recall
now how it was that I should forget what we talked about in 1984 but
remember how pleasant it all was. Then to my sleeping-bag on the floor, and
a deep sleep.
    The next day passed in very lazy fashion. I was stiff and sore after the
ordeal the day before, so we spent the day wandering around the farm in
leisurely fashion, meeting the sheep, the chickens, and the other resident
critters. We wandered down to the beach that looks out onto an arm of the
Manukau. Mud, grey and slimy, dotted here and there with mangroves
migrating onto the property from a neighbour's attempt at land reclamation.
Maree found the presence of these self-sown seedlings offensive, and as she
walked along she would bend down and pluck out any that came within
reach. This activity proved infectious, and soon we were both hunting back
and forth across the beach, pulling out the invading plants like birds after
worms. Then we stopped, flushed and laughing, and sat down on a driftwood
log for a while to rest, and Maree talked a bit about the area while she put
her shoes back on.
    One of our shared interests is Leslie Charteris' `Saint' books. That night
we rediscovered this mutual interest, and spent much of the evening
discussing the books, the Saint, Charteris, and the club that is named after
the character (set up after WW II to help build and support a hospital in
blitzed London). (I have a recent card from Maree which has her new
address in Auckland and also a note to say that she is now a member of the
Saint Club. ***Green*** I never got myself that far together -- but maybe
while travelling in 1989 --) Winnie-the-Pooh and other abiding loves got
dragged in, and we dug out the various Saint and Pooh books and started
quoting favourite passages at each other. All very silly, perhaps, but it was
fun. I didn't get to my sleeping bag until after 2am.
    The next day I started home. Maree, wearing a straw hat, saw me to the
gate, and my last view of her was a slouched country yokel leaning on a
wooden stock-gate, chewing on a stalk of grass. All carefully posed, of
course. She works as a librarian and is doing quite well at it, and if she is any
less at-home in the city as in the country, she conceals it well.
    I decided not to tempt fate by trying to cycle all the way back to Te Aroha
that day. I'd only reached Waiuku in a day because I had the broad flat
Hauraki Plains to speed across while my legs were fresh. Going back I would
reach the plains tired, and still with the legacy of the outward trip hanging
on me. But I had heard of a motor-camp at a place called Miranda Hot
Springs, over on the western shore of the Firth of Thames. It was about 65
kilometres from Maree's place and about 75 from Te Aroha, a perfect two-
stage journey since the short stage was hilly and the long stage flat. So I
retraced part of my outward route, then struck left up a side-road as I
descended the hills towards the plains. This took me into more hills, but the
views from the peaks were wonderful! I stopped at one point when I saw a
movement in a tree beside the road. A possum, blinking at me with sleepy
day-time eyes.
    Most of the route was in bush, but towards the end I came out onto naked
summits and rutted farm-tracks. Then the final peak, and suddenly I could
see the Firth of Thames below me, with the long green-grey dragon-back of
the Coromandels beyond. It amused me to think that I might be standing on
one of the very spots that I had looked at with so much curiosity during my
Coromandel excursions. The scene inspired me and I sketched it on a card,
which I addressed and later posted to Maree. I wonder if she got it? I'd like
a copy of that card -- I recall that the drawing was, by my standards, quite
good, and I added notes commenting on the various shades and colours.
    Down a twisting road and onto a narrow stretch of flat land that divided
the Firth from the hills. I had taken the wrong road and found myself about
six kilometres north of where I wanted to be. Turn and ride until I found the
signpost, then up a stone-strewn road to the Miranda Hot Springs Motor
Camp.
    The tent site cost me $5 for the night, but I paid it cheerfully, for that
price included access to the hot pool that was the camp's main attraction --
entry to which was normally $3.50 anyway!
    The pool turned out to be a huge rectangular basin with a number of steps
leading bathers from the shallow edges to the deeper centre. It was an open-
air affair, which proved amusing when it rained (as it did, just after dark).
In one corner was a huge tv-repeater-screen. The hot water (not really hot,
just warmer than tepid) came up through many small vents in the concrete
that sheathed the pool. Apparently there was not one major spring, but
rather hundreds of small seepings through cracks in the underlying rock. The
pool-builders had tracked down the larger cracks and channelled them into
the pool.
    I made the acquaintance of the camp's owners, and we got on quite well.
I told them about Te Aroha and they told me about the relatives they had
in the area. I admired the T-shirts advertising the camp that were selling for
$15 from the camp store. `You like them? Have one! -- all you have to do
is promise to wear it every now and then!' I told them that I planned to go
back to Te Aroha the next day. `But it's going to rain tomorrow. You'll get
soaked!' Well, yes, but I had to be getting back. `Well, we're going shopping
in Paeroa tomorrow. If you can wait until midday, we'll give you a lift that
far.' And so it happened. Very nice people and a very nice camp.
                                    ###
Through The Heart:
I went and worked on the Kiwifruit again in May, using my annual leave for
the purpose. Nothing like being paid twice for my time, huh? But
unfortunately the story of the kiwifruit will just have to wait for the
solicitation of some material-less faned; I have no room for it.
    I did not, however, spend the whole month of my leave picking fruit.
Towards the end, I got pissed-off with the way my employer was running his
teams of pickers, and decided that enough was enough!, and cycled off into
the sunset. Well, not the sunset exactly, but in the same general direction.
I had been working near Te Puke (actually some distance out on the far side
from Tauranga). When I left the orchard I went back to Tauranga for a few
days. So I decided to make my first day's staging the approximately 85 km
from Tauranga to Rotorua.
    The first part was relatively easy -- cross the small peninsula that central
Tauranga squats on, cross the harbour via a railbridge (shorter than using
the main road), up a connecting road to Highway 2, then along to the
Rotorua turnoff at Highway 33. But then things turned difficult. 
    I found myself dropping gears for no obvious reason. I was used enough
to cycle-touring by now that I could judge my progress fairly well even
without looking at the speedometer and doing mental calculations of time
versus distance. It soon became plain that I was not making as much distance
for effort as I thought that I should be. It took a longer period of
observation before the reason came to me: I was climbing up from sea level
onto a vast plate of volcanic debris, vomit of ancient activity by the volcanic
zone that reaches from Rotorua to Ruapehu. This `Volcanic Plateau' (as it
was called in my schoolboy geography lessons) surrounds the mountains and
stretches east to the sea, forming the coastline of the bay of Plenty. But the
layer of debris thins very gradually as you leave the volcanoes behind. There
is no noticeable slope by very reason of the gradual nature of the change:
the land is tilted. The horizon matches it. Lacking the means of comparison,
the eye assumes that the landscape is horizontal -- but it isn't.
    I persevered. The vegetation gradually changed from the lush green of the
coast to the darker green of inland forest. Then I passed between two lakes
and entered the region of  thermal activity that surrounds Rotorua. I
cheered to myself as I passed through Te Ngae (Tay-ngye), the turnoff to
`Hell's Gate' at Tikitere (Tih-kee-teh-ree) -- the milestone that told me I was
almost there. To my right lay Lake Rotorua, with a green island set in it --
Mokoia, setting of a famous Maori love story. At my left, tall pillars of white
steam marked thermal areas.
    Rotorua is a city of about 58,000 people, built on the shores of a volcanic
lake. If the reader is familiar with any part of NZ at all, that part is probably
Rotorua. (The next most likely places are the Bay of Islands and Queens-
town.) So I won't go into much detail here. The place is a tourist trap --
prices high, and everything of honest culture sacrificed for the Tourist
Dollar. The air reeks of sulphur. The inhabitants are very proud of their
geysers and mud pools, but are also addicted to having their own private hot
pools in their back yards, with the result that the water table is dropping
disastrously, killing off the geysers and mud pools. Sad (but all too human).
    I had been here before, of course. The trip after this (and my final visit
before leaving NZ) yields me very pleasant memories, for I met up with a
German hosteller, Inge, and we spent three happy (and quite platonic) days
exploring the place together. Inge is bright and is one of those people who
can walk into a strange place and, in ten minutes, strike up a friendship with
someone. (She visited me in Melbourne in 1988, before setting out on a
month's bus-back exploration of the country. The day she went to Adelaide,
I left her at the bus terminal cheerfully -- and sure enough, in the twenty
minutes or so between the time we parted and the time the bus left, she met
up with an interesting German couple living in Adelaide. The man had a
passionate belief in the evil of Supermarket waste, and had gotten into
trouble several times for his habit of salvaging goods from supermarket
rubbish and giving the still-edible or usable items to poor people who
couldn't afford to buy them new.) She made the perfect foil to my own
reserve, given that I was in travelling mode at the time and so somewhat less
staid than normal. So we went to the fisheries at Rainbow springs and
soaked at the Polynesian Pools and visited Whakarewarewa (Fahka-ray-wah-
ray-wah), the major thermal area closest to the city, and which also has a
Maori Arts Centre.
    This trip I only stayed two nights before pressing on the 82-kilometres to
Lake Taupo (Tow-poh). Rugged countryside, red soil (an unusual colour for
NZ, though common in Australia), climbing into the centre of the island,
then a swift descent to the shores of Taupo. Taupo, filling the blasted-out
roots of ancient volcanoes, is the largest lake in NZ, and it is famous for its
trout fishing. On the way into Taupo city I stopped at the Honey Village, a
complex dealing with various varieties of honey and the odd combinations
resulting from adding such things as fruits and nuts. Samples are laid out on
tables, with wooden spatulas supplied in jars nearby. Take a spatula and dip
it in whatever honey takes your fancy, lick the specimen, dispose of the stick.
Not a place for gluttons! Some hostellers I've spoken to went there and
made themselves quite sick by pigging out on the free tasting. (Similar to
getting drunk on wine-tasting expeditions, I suppose.) If you want to, you can
finish the expedition by purchasing jars of your favourite flavours when
leaving.
    At Taupo I stayed in Rainbow Lodge, a private hostel built and run by a
couple who once ran hostels for YHA. In 1986, the two best non-YHA
hostels in NZ were run by ex-YHA Managers. (The other was in
Christchurch.) Rainbow Lodge was very new when I was there; the interior
was not completely finished (it had opened in order to get some cash coming
in).

  -- Christa (Denmark)' (Te Aroha V. B.)
________________________________________________
    It started raining, so I stayed two nights at Rainbow Lodge. By the time
the rain eased, the visitors had formed a tight-knit little community, and
everyone was sorry when it came time to move on. (Several of these people
later came through Te Aroha, some while I was away, a couple while I was
`in residence'; which made for several pleasant nights of story-telling and
comparison of notes.) Of course, like any group, not everyone liked everyone
else, and there was the inevitable untidy element who would leave dirty
dishes lying around, not bathe for days, or come noisily back from the pub
in the early hours and throw up on the floor, leaving the mess to others to
clean up if they themselves weren't caught and firmly made to clean it up
themselves. (Such creatures are found less in YHA hostels than `private'
ones -- the YHA system polices and eventually purges itself of persistently
offensive characters, before these individuals can do real damage. In the
private area, supposedly `mature' `adult' people will do the most amazingly
antisocial deeds before the community bands together to get rid of them --
and even then, the offenders will often turn up again and again elsewhere.)
    Now came the day of folly: I set off into the drizzle, determined to try the
137-kilometre leg from Taupo to Ohakune (Oh-hah-koo-nay). I should have
known better: 137 kilometres is a long day's cycle at the best of times, but
now it was approaching the shortest day of the year, I wanted to pass the
highest mountains in the North Island, and I compounded it by setting out
late in the morning. (I was not totally bereft of wit -- I did intend to leave
Highway 1 at Turangi (Too-rahng-gee) rather than follow the main highway
down the desolate Desert Road on the east side of the mountains to
Waiouru (Wye-ooh-roo). That area has a reputation for being dangerous to
benighted travellers.)
    I cruised easily along Highway 1, following the rolling shoreline of Lake
Taupo, admiring the beauty of the lake in the rare moments of sunshine.
The far shore (or rather, the hills behind it) was barely visible on the
horizon, and the waves that came in were larger than you might expect from
a lake. I made good time for the first 50 kilometres -- just over two hours.
But then I decided to take the scenic route, Highway 47a instead of Highway
47, to pass by the western slopes of the mountains. I had forgotten just how
high the first step of the mountain-base was: when I passed through Tokaanu
(Toh-kah-noo) and saw what was waiting for me, I quailed. The road climbs
to 745 metres to cross the Te Poninga (Tay-poh-ning-gah) saddle. (Of
course, the land was something like half a kilometre high already, so I had
only a few hundred metres to climb, but most of the extra height comes in
a single winding slope about four or five kilometres long.)
    Nothing for it. I pushed my bike up. Took me three hours, which put me
past 2 pm, with perhaps three hours of usable day left and almost seventy
kilometres of hostile up-and-down to cover if I wanted to reach Ohakune
that day. Couldn't be done.
    Well, having reached the saddle, at least I had a couple of kilometres of
coasting ahead of me. I climbed back onto my bike and pushed off, the
peaks on either side (1160 and 1325 metres) acting as starting posts. I bent
low over the handlebars, holding the lower grips fiercely, flicking occasional
amazed glances at the speedometer as it swung around and around, finally
quivering on 95 kph -- terminal velocity, I guess. The wind was vicious, even
with sunglasses protecting my eyeballs from the worst blast. I swung wide on
the curves and prayed that I didn't meet a car at the wrong moment. Gentle
tests with the brakes assured me that there was no way I could stop other
than catastrophically before I reached the bottom. What slowing I had to do
from time to time was sufficient to overheat the pads, leaving a thin black
circle of rubber on the wheel-rims, even though I tried to alternate between
front and back to minimise the friction. I certainly had no desire to pull back
with full force: I have a vivid memory of my childhood, when I tried that on
a hillside in Wanganui. The rubber shoes popped out, leaving me to
accelerate horribly and finally crash through a corral-type fence at the
bottom, knocking myself out but -- by some fluke -- collecting only a few
bruises and scratches otherwise. I could hope for no such happy ending here!
    Even so I had time to watch the scenery and to note the green waters of
tiny Lake Rotopounamu (Roh-toh-poo-nah-moo) as I passed high above it.
    I made it down safely, and stopped to pee at the roadside, feeling shaky
at the knees, when I finally halted my mad career on the flats near Lake
Rotoaira (Roh-toh-eye-rah).
    I pushed on, but the road was crossing the long ridge-lines that radiate
from the mountains. Already tired from mounting the saddle, I found myself
walking more and more. Then dusk fell, and I finally found a small flat area
well off the road to use as a camp.
    Snug in my thick sleeping bag and windproof tent, I slept well. Next
morning I stepped out into -4 degrees of heavy frost... When I rode on, I was
so well-wrapped against the cold that I looked like a ball.
    The land was wide, covered with brown tussock, plunging in one direction
into a distant complex of hills, rising in the other into an intricately-
patterned and snow-capped wall of stone: the three volcanoes at the heart
of the North Island -- Tongariro (Tong-gah-rare-oh), 1968 metres;
Ngaurohoe (Ngarra-hoh-ee), 2291 metres; and Ruapehu, 2797 metres. The
latter two are classified as `active', but this day only a slight steam from
Ngaurohoe showed it.
    Although there are three major mountains in the group, only about three
kilometres separates the peaks of Tongariro and Ngaurohoe, with a wide,
relatively low saddle between them and Ruapehu. (The higher of the two
peaks flanking the Te Poninga saddle is called Pihanga (Pih-hahng-gah), and
Maori legend claims the mountain is female -- the wife of Tongariro. It
seems that a third mountain, Taranaki, once stood nearby, and he coveted
his neighbour's wife. Angered, Tongariro fought with Taranaki and finally
drove him away with fire and rocks. Taranaki fled to the sea, wounded foot
digging the valley now filled by the Wanganui River; then he waded up the
coast and finally settled down in the centre of the western `fin' of Maui's
`fish'. Today, after many years of being known as `Mt Egmont' (so-named by
the white man) he is again ruling his wide domains under his own name.)
    After a while my eyes adjusted to the scale of the countryside -- I thought
-- and I suddenly noticed a child's toy house standing on a hillside some way
off the road. It had obviously been patterned after a European manor-house.
It was blocky, multi-storied, and slope-roofed. I was surprised that such a
beautiful and detailed toy should be left out in this desolate place --and then
I realised my error. I should have realised earlier: I was looking up the long
flank of Ruapehu at the Chateau Tongariro. What looked small and close
was really more than fifteen kilometres away, and was the only man-made
element in the landscape capable of making itself noticed against the
grandeur of the mountains.
    I slogged away until I met the turnoff to the Chateau. On impulse, I
essayed the six-kilometre uphill climb and spent a couple of hours looking
around the ski village that has grown up around the imposing building
(which is a ski-hotel run by the Tourist Hotel Corporation). Someday I shall
stay there. The family went there once on holiday, but I was too young to
remember it very clearly.
     My back tire had gone flat, so I fixed it. I left my pocket-knife lying on
a step beside where I fixed my bike. Didn't realise it until I wanted to use
it to shave some kindling for the fireplace at the Ohakune YHA.
    The return trip to Highway 47 flew by, and I laughed into the wind. This
random side-trip was proof to me that my long nights and days of
introspection and self-analysis were not going to waste -- the person I had
been in 1984 would not have turned aside from their pre-planned route to
snoop around the Chateau! Now I could settle down to killing the 44
kilometres that separated me from Ohakune.
    The YHA hostel at Ohakune is an older structure, somewhat run-down,
and relies on the ski travellers in winter to keep it profitable. When I was
there this trip, it was being run by Tomoko, a Japanese hosteller who had
been supplementing her NZ trip by relieving at various hostels. I'd heard
about her through the internal communication of YHA and by reputation
from hostellers, and was very pleased to meet her at last. She had a very
sweet, somewhat `lost' personality that was very appealing. Not surprisingly,
she was very popular with the visitors at the various hostels she ran. We
spent quite a while talking about our various adventures. (Some time later,
in her final days in NZ, she came to Te Aroha. We still keep in touch.
Someday I shall get to Japan and visit her in her own country.)
    Two nights at Ohakune, and it was time to attempt the final leg: Ohakune
to Wanganui via `the Parapara' (Pah-rah-pah-rah) and Highway 4. 100
kilometres of winding hill-road, with the three great hills of the Parapara
looming at the gates of my home town. It was hell, though I made it through
as planned. I was in familiar territory and so couldn't lose myself in the
scenery the way I had elsewhere, but some interest was provided by playing
leap-frog with a Japanese traveller (Joichi? His name slips my mind) riding
a 50 cc motor-scooter. He would pass me as I walked or cycled upgrade;
then I would catch and pass him on the far side. He didn't finally leave me
behind until we reached the willow-covered banks of the Wanganui River.
    Although I took no particular notice of the scenery, Highway 4 is
nevertheless one of the prettier roads in NZ, with its steep hillsides and
many rows of stately poplars.
    Wanganui. I cycled in along the riverbank, relaxing as the suburb Aramoho
(Ah-rah-moh-ho) appeared on the far bank. The River is about fifty metres
wide, filled with very muddy brown water. When the tide is on the ebb it
flows placidly to the sea. When the tide is on the flood it flows placidly from
the sea! I came in through Wanganui East and crossed at the City Bridge,
cycled up Victoria Avenue (main street) and made the final easy section to
my parents' home in the seaside suburb of Castlecliff.
    I stayed a few days, then, not having time to cycle north before an
important appointment, bussed to Hamilton, cycling from there to Te Aroha
in the early hours of the morning, arriving home to an empty hostel. Sigh.
But My satisfaction at having completed this odyssey was enough. Now I was
a real cycle-tourist.
                                    ###
The three trips I've talked about here were three of the four main cycle-
tours I went on. The one not recounted was the Rotorua trip, in August,
mentioned briefly above, in which I met Inge. Now that was a hard-luck trip
if ever I had one. Before I even got out of Te Aroha I discovered that two
of the struts supporting my rear wheel (the two diagonal ones that meet the
frame near the seat) had come loose, requiring a quick stop at a local garage
to get them welded back into place. Then I'd left my cheque-book in Te
Aroha and had with me only my Post Office Savings Bank passbook -- with
almost nothing in it. If I hadn't been able to arrange with Dannie and Helen
to telegraph some money through to me, I would have been forced to make
an ignominious return to Te Aroha. (Inge had offered to lend me money,
but I didn't want to ruin my trip by worrying about getting it back to her
later. Better to cancel the trip and try again later.) Other things went wrong
on the way from Rotorua to Tauranga, and the final section, back to Te
Aroha via the Karangahake Gorge, saw me: (1) hit a stone and destroy a tire
(as well as denting the metal rim, leaving the bike with a permanent `bump-
bump-bump' sensation when in motion); (2) try to turn too sharply, resulting
in the bike stopping dead while I cruised on to skin my palms on the road;
(3) swerve too wide on a turn and come within a few centimetres of going
under a truck. In short, if it hadn't been for those three idyllic days in
Rotorua, I'd have come out in worse condition than I entered the trip.
    Apart from these four main trips, there were a number of lesser ones,
mainly into the Coromandel and starting or ending at Opoutere.
    I think that discovering the pleasures of touring by bike was one of the
best discoveries I made at Te Aroha. With my bike, and with the extended
weekends made possible by the setup at Te Aroha, I was able to get the
feeling of travelling, even though I never really went anywhere. The
environment -- surrounded by travellers from all over the world -- was pretty
much what I could have expected had I been travelling myself, yet if I'd been
confined to the hostel area all the time it might soon have palled somewhat.
But whenever things started to feel closed-in, I could load up the wheels and
take a spin someplace else.
    The cycle-touring idea was helped along by the nature of the area. The
region covered by the maps on pages 8 & 15 is one of the most scenic in the
North Island, packing in more goodies per square kilometre than almost any
other area of comparable size in the world -- so the various visitors from all
over told me. I was very fortunate to have the opportunity Te Aroha's
location offered me.
                                    ###
________________________________________________
  `Well  folks,   two  of  the  NZYHA National
  Executive  came  for  a  visit  yesterday to
  discuss the future of  this  hostel.  Essen-
  tially  the  YHA  wants  to close uneconomic
  hostels such as Te Aroha and  8  others,  or
  at  least make arrangements so that they are
  not an economic drain  on  YHA  finance.  It
  seemed  to me that they would be going ahead
  with this decision even though many  of  the
  National  Executive  are  supporters  of the
  small hostel. It appears that the YHA may be
  willing to  allow  the  smaller  hostels  to
  operate  outside the present Warden's Agree-
  ment  (which sets wages and conditions)  and
  arrange their own local employment  contract
  and supervision arrangements.  In this sense
  Te Aroha should  continue  as  it  has  good
  local  support,  but  where  this is not the
  case you can expect closures  such as Whaka-
  tane.  I believe it is essential to maintain
  the smaller  hostels  as  they  provide  the
  character  and  local flavour of the system,
  unlike the large accommodation  centres  type
  hostels.  To  maintain  these  small hostels
  they must receive a regular flow  of  people
  so  that  means we should try and visit some
  of the other  smaller  hostels  around  this
  country  and  extol  the  virtues of them in
  other day books.
       Enough for the news bulletin.  Te Aroha
  is a great  place  to  rest,  relax,  or  be
  active  in a great countryside  --  all  the
  comforts of home except a  TV  (an essential
  item with the World Cup at the moment), even
  sheep outside the bathroom windows.

________________________________________________
Auckland and Out:
As I've already said once in this long, long chapter, all things end. There is
a great deal yet unsaid about my time at Te Aroha -- the Kiwifruit, the
Managers conference in Christchurch in early June; all sorts of odd
occurrences and observations. But to tell it all would double the length of
this episode. I especially regret putting aside the story of my fortnight's
training at Kerikeri YH in August 1985, since that provided plenty of
adventures and also would provide an insight on the operation of a relatively
busy hostel.
    Another thing I especially regret is the necessity of leaving out anecdotes
about other hostellers; such as Klaus from Germany, who had a penchant for
interminable sentences which would go on and on for several dozen words,
all constructed with excellent grammar except for such characteristically
German features as `I have still to go to...' and `I am taking six months so
far...', using multisyllabic words and ordinary words in novel ways, and all
spoken with a machinelike precision and rhythm that sometimes made the
actual meaning of the sentence impervious to the listener, who would find
themselves nodding in time to the syllables and listening to the sound rather
than the meaning. The sentence you have just read is an attempt to recreate
a sample.
    Wayne came from Canada. He was a regular feature at the hostel, six
months of the year. Alas, he was not allowed permanent residence in the
country he loved most, and so would have to spend the other six months of
the year in North America. He drove around in a yellow mini, which he
would leave with someone in Auckland during the interregnums. His obliging
nature extended to such features as taxiing a concerned hostel manager
thirty kilometres in the dusk once in order to track down a missing hosteller
(who turned up back at the hostel while we were out searching the roadside
for him). (He took note of my interest in seeing Canada and, when he went
back there in 1986, he posted me a copy of a booklet about Canadian
National Parks -- including one of my particular dream-places, Lake of the
Woods. Now maybe in 1989...)
    But I haven't space to tell a story about everyone I met and liked. I need
to leave someone out somewhere. Let it stand...
    I've also said less about the actual mechanics of being a hostel manager
than I might. The job itself is quite simple -- book people in, book people
out; keep track of the money and account for it to Head Office with a
monthly report; keep the hostel clean and safe from fire and other disaster;
be a host to the hostellers -- give them a shoulder to cry on if they need it,
point them at the best places to go and the best things to do. It's
challenging, not in the sense of being complex, but in the variety and nature
of the things you are called upon to do in the course of executing the above-
mentioned simple duties.
    One thing I could never quite escape was the feeling of impending doom
that hung over Te Aroha and a number of other small hostels. YHANZ was
the battleground of several conflicting factions. Some wanted to cut off all
unprofitable hostels; others thought all should be kept, and as many `private'
hostels as possible should be persuaded to affiliate; still others thought the
employment of professional managers a mistake and that YHANZ should
return to the more casual system of years gone by. All these plans had
inherent problems. A major spanner existed in the form of the new Mt Cook
YHA project, which was expected to cost upwards of $750,000. To raise this
sum -- and nobody disputed that the new hostel was necessary and that the
money must therefore be made available -- budgets for several years had
been slashed, maintenance programs on smaller hostels held up, and fund-
raising ventures had been embarked-on.
    Te Aroha really couldn't afford a permanent manager's salary, even a
salary as small as mine. I did my best to push the usage of the hostel  up, 
but  even  at 100% capacity all the time, the hostel would lose money. Yet
it was accepted as a legal requirement that the hostel could not operate
without a resident manager. By mid-1986, however, ways had been found
around this obstacle. Larger hostels would continue much as before, but
medium-range hostels would go over to a `leasing' arrangement between the
managers and YHA, an arrangement designed to stop YHA bleeding into
money-losing hostels and give the managers an incentive to make them
profitable. Smaller hostels would either close or (where possible) find ways
to provide live-in supervision without paying salaries. This meant that hostels
supported by local YHA Branches would probably survive, especially with
the help of local fundraising for repairs, etc.
    This did not mean I would lose my job. There were enough hostels around
whose managers were unwilling to operate under the new conditions so that
I would be able to transfer to one of them if I liked. I thought very seriously
about taking up this option, for I enjoyed the job very much.
    But in the end, travel won out. I realised that whatever new hostel I went
to would be busier than Te Aroha and would necessitate a more structured
approach towards weekends. I would be working harder but the recreation
I enjoyed so much would be cramped into a series of two-day segments. At
least until I got my round-the-world ideas out of my system, I would
probably be better off getting out of the job while it was a pleasure, thereby
`saving' it as an option for years to come rather than burning up my interest
now.
    Since a dark night on Opoutere Beach in February, my vague ideas
regarding travel had taken on shape and structure. Serendipity stepped in,
and I acquired a cheap air ticket to Australia. On the 19th of September
1986 I again boarded a plane to Australia. How this came about, what I
planned to do there, and what actually happened between then and 1st
January 1987 is the subject for `History' Part Six. It will bring the tale up to
the publication of SECANT 1, which, as endings, beginnings, and returns go, 
has a nice Ouroboros ring to it. See you then.

                                    ###
I appended the following to this article in SECANT 5:
SECANT 6: `The Happy Return'
THE next issue of SECANT will bring the conclusion to `History'. (`And not
before time!' I hear you cry.) Since it is concerned with my return to
Australia, and what I found there, I have given it the title `The Happy
Return'. After some thought, I have decided that will be the theme of that
issue of SECANT, too.

That chapter was never written.

There is a theory which states  that  if  ever  anyone  discovers
exactly  what  the  Universe  is  for and why it is here, it will
instantly disappear  and  be  replaced  by  something  even  more
bizarre and inexplicable.
=================================================================
There is another  theory  which  states  that  this  has  already
happened.
=================================================================
Chapter 1
The story so far:
In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded
as a bad move.
Many races believe that it was  created  by  some  sort  of  God,
though  the  Jatravartid  people of Viltvodle VI believe that the
entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose  of  a  being
called the Great Green Arkleseizure.
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear  of  the  time  they
call  The  Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue
creatures with more than  fifty  arms  each,  who  are  therefore
unique  in  being  the  only race in history to have invented the
aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
However, the  Great  Green  Arkleseizure  Theory  is  not  widely
accepted  outside  Viltvodle  VI  and  so, the Universe being the
puzzling place it is, other  explanations  are  constantly  being
sought.
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent  pan-dimensional  beings
once  built  themselves  a  gigantic  supercomputer  called  Deep
Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the  Ultimate
Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
For seven and a half million years,  Deep  Thought  computed  and
calculated,  and in the end announced that the answer was in fact
Forty-two - and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built
to find out what the actual question was.
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large  that
it  was  frequently  mistaken  for  a  planet - especially by the
strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface,  totally  unaware
that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.
And this is very odd, because  without  that  fairly  simple  and
obvious  piece  of  knowledge,  nothing that ever happened on the
Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense.
Sadly however, just before the critical moment  of  readout,  the
Earth  was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so
they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so  all  hope  of
discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.
Or so it would seem.
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived.
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend
of  his,  Ford  Prefect,  suddenly  turned out to be from a small
planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he
had  hitherto  claimed;  and,  more  to the point, he knew how to
hitch rides on flying saucers.
Tricia McMillian - or Trillian  -  had  skipped  the  planet  six
months  earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the
Galaxy.
Two survivors.
They are  all  that  remains  of  the  greatest  experiment  ever
conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer
of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship  is
drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship
is moving slowly towards them.
=================================================================
Chapter 2
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it  had  been  not  so  much
designed  as  congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have  disfigured
the  looks  of  most  ships,  but  in  this  case  that was sadly
impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not
by reliable witnesses.
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship  you  would
have  to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however,
this is precisely what you will avoid doing because  the  average
Vogon  will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly
hideous to you that you will wish you had never been  born  -  or
(if  you  are  a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never
been born.
In fact, the average Vogon probably  wouldn't  even  think  once.
They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and
thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical
analysis  of  the  Vogon  reveals that its brain was originally a
badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest  thing
you  can  say about them, then, is that they know what they like,
and  what  they  like  generally  involves  hurting  people  and,
wherever possible, getting very angry.
One  thing  they  don't  like  is  leaving  a  job  unfinished  -
particularly this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons -
this job.
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic
Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of
demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth.
He heaved his monumentally vile body round  in  his  ill-fitting,
slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship
Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned.
It mattered little to him  that  the  Heart  of  Gold,  with  its
Infinite   Improbability   Drive,  was  the  most  beautiful  and
revolutionary ship ever built.  Aesthetics  and  technology  were
closed  books  to  him  and, had he had his way, burnt and buried
books as well.
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox  was  aboard.
Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  now  the ex-President of the Galaxy, and
though every police force in the Galaxy  was  currently  pursuing
both  him  and  this  ship  he  had  stolen,  the  Vogon  was not
interested.
He had other fish to fry.
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little  bribery  and
corruption  in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds,
and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the  words
"integrity"  or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary,
and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he
reached for the rule book and threw it away.
In seeking so implacably the destruction of  the  Earth  and  all
that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call
of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether
the  said  bypass  was actually going to be built, but the matter
had been glossed over.
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.
"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist  on  the
line."
Within a few seconds the face of Gag  Halfrunt  appeared  on  the
screen,  smiling  the  smile  of  a man who knew he was ten light
years away from the Vogon  face  he  was  looking  at.  Mixed  up
somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon
persistently  referred  to  him  as  "my   private   brain   care
specialist"  there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it
was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He  was  paying
him  an  awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of
the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he  and
a  consortium  of  his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an
awful lot of money when it  seemed  that  the  entire  future  of
psychiatry might be at stake.
"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and  how
are we feeling today?"
The Vogon captain told him that in the  last  few  hours  he  had
wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.
Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant.
"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour  for
a  Vogon,  you  know?  The natural and healthy channelling of the
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence."
"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say."
"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I  think  that  this  is  perfectly
normal  behaviour  for  a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both
very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today.  Now  tell  me,
what news of the mission?"
"We have located the ship."
"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?"
"The Earthman is there."
"Excellent! And ...?"
"A female from the same planet. They are the last."
"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?"
"The man Prefect."
"Yes?"
"And Zaphod Beeblebrox."
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered.
"Ah yes," he said,  "I  had  been  expecting  this.  It  is  most
regrettable."
"A personal friend?"  inquired  the  Vogon,  who  had  heard  the
expression somewhere once and decided to try it out.
"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know,  we  do  not
make personal friends."
"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment."
"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack."
He paused. His mouth continued to smile,  but  his  eyes  frowned
slightly.
"But Beeblebrox, you know," he  said,  "he  is  one  of  my  most
profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams
of analysts."
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing
"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?"
"Yes."
"Good. Destroy the ship immediately."
"What about Beeblebrox?"
"Well," said Halfrunt brightly,  "Zaphod's  just  this  guy,  you
know?"
He vanished from the screen.
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button  which  connected
him with the remains of his crew.
"Attack," he said.
At that  precise  moment  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  in  his  cabin
swearing  very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would
go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe,
whereupon  he  had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and
stormed off to his cabin shouting that  he  would  work  out  the
Improbability factors with a pencil.
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful
and  unpredictable  ship  in  existence.  There  was  nothing  it
couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that
the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching
it.  He  didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he
liked it.
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy,  except
that it seemed a fun thing to be.
He did know that there were better reasons than these,  but  that
they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.
He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go
away  because  they  occasionally  surfaced  momentarily  and put
strange thoughts into the light, fun sections  of  his  mind  and
tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business
of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time.  He  had
run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.
"Starpox!" he shouted.
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in  mid  air.  This
was  not  because  of  anything  wrong with the ship's artificial
gravity field, but because he was  leaping  down  the  stair-well
which  led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump
to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled,  recovered,
raced  down  the  corridor  sending a couple of miniature service
robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door
and explained what was on his mind.
"Vogons," he said.
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin
in  search  of  a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon
with a great deal of optimism., because he  knew  that  the  only
source  of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of
equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It  was
called  a  Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered
it before.
It claimed  to  produce  the  widest  possible  range  of  drinks
personally  matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared
to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably  produced
a  plastic  cup  filled  with  a  liquid that was almost, but nit
quite, entirely unlike tea.
He attempted to reason with the thing.
"Tea," he said.
"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with  yet
another cup of the sickly liquid.
He threw it away.
"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated  and  provided  him  with
another one.
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the  hugely  successful
Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Complaints  division, which now
covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is
the  only  part  of  the  Corporation  to have shown a consistent
profit in recent years.
The motto  stands  -  or  rather  stood  -  in  three  mile  high
illuminated  letters  near the Complaints Department spaceport on
Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly  after  it
was  erected,  the  ground  beneath the letters caved in and they
dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of  many
talented young complaints executives - now deceased.
The protruding upper halves of the letters  now  appear,  in  the
local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no
longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.
"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any
drink  in  existence,  so  why  do  you  keep  giving me the same
undrinkable stuff?"
"Nutrition and pleasurable  sense  data,"  burbled  the  machine.
"Share and Enjoy."
"It tastes filthy!"
"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the
machine, "why not share it with your friends?"
"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try
to comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink ..."
"That  drink,"  said  the  machine  sweetly,  "was   individually
tailored  to  meet  your  personal requirements for nutrition and
pleasure."
"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?"
"Share and Enjoy."
"Oh shut up."
"Will that be all?"
Arthur decided to give up.
"Yes," he said.
Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up.
"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple ... all I  want  ...
is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and
listen."
And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about
China,  he  told  it  about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves
drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots.  He  told  it
about  summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in
the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even  told
it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.
"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished.
"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want."
"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?"
"Er, yes. With milk."
"Squirted out of a cow?"
"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose ..."
"I'm going to need some help with this  one,"  said  the  machine
tersely.  All  the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice
and it now meant business.
"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur.
"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him.
It summoned up the ship's computer.
"Hi there!" said the ship's computer.
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's  computer.  The
computer  boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and
together they lapsed into a grim silence.
Arthur watched and  waited  for  a  while,  but  nothing  further
happened.
He thumped it, but still nothing happened.
Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.
In the empty wastes of space,  the  Heart  of  Gold  hung  still.
Around  it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it
crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.
=================================================================
Chapter 3
"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to  the
bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at
the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod  was
kicking  it,  and  also  why there was a nasty yellow lump on the
vision screen.
He put down the empty cup he was  carrying  and  walked  over  to
them.
"Hello?" he said.
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the  polished  marble
surfaces  that  contained  the  instruments  that  controlled the
conventional photon drive. They materialized  beneath  his  hands
and  he  flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he
pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly  judder  and
cut out again.
"Something up?" said Arthur.
"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now  for  the
manual  controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey
spoke!"
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then  also  cut
out.
"Pure history,  man,"  said  Zaphod,  kicking  the  Improbability
Drive, "a talking monkey!"
"If you're upset about something ..." said Arthur.
"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!"
Arthur gibbered.
"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!"
"Can't. Computer's jammed."
"Jammed?"
"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere
in the ship."
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across
his forehead and slumped back against the wall.
"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing  and  bit  his
lip.
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the  Earth  had
been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at
all good at it, and his particular speciality  had  been  scoring
own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to
experience a peculiar tingling round the back of  his  neck  that
would  slowly  creep  up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The
image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering  boys  flinging
it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.
A peculiar tingling  sensation  at  the  back  of  his  neck  was
creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow.
He started to speak, and stopped.
He started to speak again and stopped again.
Finally he managed to speak.
"Er," he said. He cleared his throat.
"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others
all  turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow
blob on the vision screen.
"Tell me,"  he  said  again,  "did  the  computer  say  what  was
occupying it? I just ask out of interest ..."
Their eyes were riveted on him.
"And, er ... well that's it really, just asking."
Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck.
"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed.
"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I  think  a
short while ago it was trying to work out how to ..."
"Yes?"
"Make me some tea."
"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping
with  that  problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you
in a while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only  matched
for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at
Arthur Dent.
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons  chose  that  moment  to
start firing.
The ship shook, the  ship  thundered.  Outside,  the  inch  thick
force-shield  around  it  blistered,  crackled and spat under the
barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon,  and
looked  as if it wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how
long Ford Prefect gave it."Three minutes and fifty  seconds,"  he
said a short while later.
"Forty-five seconds,"  he  added  at  the  appropriate  time.  He
flicked  idly  at  some  useless  switches,  then  gave Arthur an
unfriendly look.
"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes  and  forty
seconds."
"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod.
"Yes," said Ford  Prefect,  "in  three  minutes  and  thirty-five
seconds."
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had
expected  a  chase,  he  had  expected  an  exciting grapple with
tractor beams, he had expected  to  have  to  use  the  specially
